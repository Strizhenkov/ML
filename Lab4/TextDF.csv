225,5,the last jedi is that very rare thing a brilliantly crafted intelligent blockbuster that will deserve every penny of its doubtless immense box-office returns
226,4,efficiently manufactured and enjoyable enough but overloaded with action and effects and sorely lacking the magic that marked the first movies in the franchise

232,5,without giving away any surprises there will be endearing reunions unexpected appearances and outcomes full review in spanish
233,3,the last jedi however opens up some new possibilities it doesnt provide a ton of satisfying answers but it creates some interesting questions and it manages to make star wars feel new again

239,4,after this i never thought id say it im up for more bring on the next star wars
240,4,the first half of the movie works in fits and starts but johnson makes up for it in the second when the bundle of subplots intertwine tighter and the narrative rockets forward its action fleet of foot and tightly tied to its emotional highs
241,5,everything a fan could want from a star wars film and then some
242,5,rian johnsons passion ends up giving wings to these last jedi who although wounded and disenchanted resist stronger than ever full review in spanish
243,5,while there are elements nodding to the empire strikes back the last jedi is no copycat in its most daring moments it even tweaks a few series tropes updating them with a decidedly populist kick
244,4,rian johnsons main feat is being savvy enough to know that sometimes the best thing to do is cherishing the past before burning it to the ground
245,3,but gradually johnsons many additions become too much of a good thing and the last jedi grows crowded busy and long
246,4,last jedi is deep its also rollicking its right up there with the very first star wars in terms of its enjoyability factor its a triumph
247,4,when everything pulls in the same direction as it does consistently in the last jedi its like watching a mind-boggling clockwork click into a deft ballet
248,4,that said id stop short of calling director rian johnsons undeniably impressive initiation into the star wars fold the masterpiece that some desperately want it to be the film simply drags too much in the middle
249,4,you cannot kill the past what you can do is build on it to enable an intriguing future at the very least the last jedi does that
250,5,carrie fisher is luminous here every time shes on screen its impossible to look away and she is as tough loving and wily as we would ever want our leia to be
251,5,the emotional pay-offs are huge the visuals are stunning the performances are brilliant and even as it eagerly explores the darkness the last jedi never loses sight of its heart
252,4,the last jedi is the best directed most beautiful-looking star wars movie since the empire strikes back
253,4,it feels fresh exciting and playful without losing the operatic grandeur star wars thrives upon
254,4,if star wars the last jedi isnt a complete deconstruction of the original trilogy its at least an acknowledgement that these archetypical characters must evolve in order to survive
255,5,its not a perfect movie by any means some of the comedy is a little too silly and one or two of the plot threads feel a bit less important than the others but these quibbles were minor when compared to the parts that work those really work
256,5,the last jedi opens up with one of the best space fights the series has seen and it carries that quality throughout it has one of the best light saber fights one of the best endings and some of the most fun the series has seen
257,5,it provides top-drawer popcorn entertainment for the casual cinema goer while hardcore fans will love it for the respect it has for the franchise history and for what it promises for the future
258,5,this is a great star wars movie possibly the best its certainly more satisfying and easily the most emotional
259,4,this mid-section marker in the current trilogy simply doesnt disappoint realising the courage of its convictions with an intelligent story and a heart-swelling emotional resonance
260,4,the movie suffers a little from uneven pacing and occasionally lost my focus here and there but it is a worthy addition to the canon
261,5,an excellent middle chapter bursting with wit wisdom emotion shocks old-fashioned derring-do state-of-the-art tech and stonking set-pieces
262,3,for those hoping that there may have been a substantial uptick in quality between jj abramss the force awakens and rian johnsons the last jedi-in much the same way that the empire strikes back improved on star wars-you may need a new hope
263,4,when the feelings come in the last jedi and they do come theyre deep and theyre real go ahead and try to watch the penultimate scene without crying or pretending not to and may the force be with you

267,4,it certainly captures the sense of awe and imagination of what we love best about that universe while its not entirely without faults it is entirely entertaining
268,5,star wars has been with us for four decades now telling that same essential story in a format thats overwhelming and engulfing with wit skill and love the last jedi takes up the torch and carries it for a new generation
269,4,by breaking down some of the old mythology rian johnson has staked out new territory for the first time in a long time a star wars film feels forward-moving
270,5,the last jedi works on several levels but most importantly its a rip-roaring good time thats what star wars fans want the most and thats what they get with this dynamite installment
271,4,sure the last jedi can occasionally be too goofy or free-roaming for its own good but its an impossible film to sit in front of and not have a good time
272,4,time and again rian johnson finds a cinematic grammar that feels new to star wars big close-ups tender touching hands top shots elegant camera tracks and pulling out in-world sound leaving just music and image
273,5,rian johnsons ability to deliver a fresh and engaging riff on this beast of an enterprise suggests that not every free-spirited storyteller can be corrupted by hollywoods dark side and some may even give it a new hope
274,5,the last jedi is the best star wars film since the empire strikes back and is awful close to being its equal
275,4,you dont see many sci-fi action extravaganzas that are about late middle-aged disappointment about wondering what its all about and whether any of it was worth it its this element that gives the last jedi an extra something 
276,5,a nuanced touching humorous adventure laced with thrilling space battles and some jaw-dropping visuals
277,4,the johnson and abrams movies live dutifully in the universe of the original george lucas trilogy after the phantom menace trilogy debacle its what fans claim they wanted
278,5,the last jedi mounts some genuinely startling narrative twists and feints while charting an onward course for the franchise that has you itching to discover what comes next
279,5,the last jedi unlike its predecessor has the freedom to be daring and perhaps the most thrilling thing about it-and there are many many thrilling things-is how abundantly it takes advantage of that freedom

281,4,star wars the last jedi makes for an inventive nail-biter of a chapter in the franchises long run
282,4,a fresh visual style makes this middle star wars a welcome addition to the saga

285,5,this is grand powerful entertainment and one of the finest films in the star wars saga
286,5,star wars the last jedi is the quintessential star wars movie it embraces everything in the franchise that came before while taking big risks to push the story into new and unexpected places

288,4,watching the last jedi is a conversation with your younger self
289,4,the last jedi is a very satisfying entry into the star wars saga with some fantastic jaw-dropping moments
290,5,thats not to say star wars the last jedi will go down in history as a better movie than the franchises gold standard the empire strikes back but director rian johnson has pulled off a complete rejuvenation of the saga
291,4,the last jedi is not a great movie because its a star wars film it reasserts star wars as a top-tier blockbuster franchise by being a great movie
292,5,the last jedi provides a resoundingly positive answer to an old smugglers long-ago query lets see what this piece of junk can do
293,4,the film not only delivers everything fans could want from the sequel but also gives them a whole load of other stuff they never knew they wanted into the bargain
294,4,more than anyone else on screen driver seems to know exactly how to pitch his character he is magnetic in his scenes and his sequences sing with space operatic melodrama that for all its showiness is absolutely correct for the piece
295,4,a stellar entry that owes much to george lucas original films while finding a signature vibe of its own and unleashing a few welcome twists
296,5,star wars the last jedi is striking stunning visually hypnotizing thrilling everything epic about the famed franchise rolled into a tremendously overcharged start to rian johnsons star wars career
297,5,star wars the last jedi is weird wild emotional and fantastic
298,4,johnson is to be lauded for not locking himself into a retelling of the same old story while there is plenty of familiarity  this franchise basically demands it  he isnt afraid to go in new directions
299,4,one of the strongest aspects of the last jedi is its writing written and directed by rian johnson he shakes the foundations of the force and puts everything we think we know to the test
300,4,this is the first star wars movie made by an artist instead of a craftsman and it leaves us on the verge of something new im very very excited to see what that might be
301,4,still this is no mere placeholder of a story huge important things happen to characters secondary and primary surprises big and small abound
302,3,put simply the last jedi is lodged several parsecs up its own black hole
303,5,im so thrilled that im able to say that star wars the last jedi made my heart soar and filled me with happiness im heartened to say that it did our carrie proud
304,4,johnson has crafted such a powerful screaming geekgasm of a movie
305,4,the last jedi gives you an explosive sugar rush of spectacle its a film that buzzes with belief in itself and its own mythic universe a euphoric certainty that i think no other movie franchise has
306,4,the most intelligent film in the franchise by several light years the last jedi can be seen as the space-opera equivalent of clint eastwoods revisionist western unforgiven
307,4,the miracle of star wars the last jedi is its rejection of series formality writerdirector rian johnson manages to honor mythology while also having fun disrupting it
308,4,the last jedi goes big on identity confusion and loss as rian johnson puts characters through the existential wringer like no star wars director before him
309,4,the best star wars since the empire strikes back
310,4,no one can say that star wars the last jedi is a previous entry in a different skin as rian johnson has crafted an installment that largely defies saga standard narrative structure and tone
311,5,rian johnson has created a movie that is both quintessentially star wars and richer than anything that has come before
312,4,for all its strengths the last jedi is a very manic film fueled by excellent ideas that could have been parsed out in smarter ways
313,4,this is the longest movie in the franchise it just doesnt feel that way i havent been this into a star wars picture since the empire struck back in the empire strikes back
314,5,rolling up with the kind of intergalactic swagger that gives us a cosmically infuriating phone prank within the first five minutes star wars the last jedi is a work of supreme confidence witty wild and free to roam unexplored territory
315,4,rian johnson has made a film that will delight and divide fans in equal measure it is a bold and brilliant new step for the saga moments of inspired silliness pure heartbreak and thrilling action
316,5,the last jedi is phenomenal bold compelling and unexpected its also the most emotional entry of the saga full review in spanish
317,4,spoiler-free review johnson sticks with the star wars house style and seems pleased to have the opportunity to inspire children with this story of overcoming inner conflict to become ones best self the key ingredient being hope
318,2,the call-backs to personnel themes and scenes all create some genuine connection to a beloved universe and for some that will be enough but in terms of plot and character the third star wars trilogy has been a misbegotten disaster
319,5,a beautiful capper to not only just this new trilogy but the entire skywalker saga
320,3,though the last jedi left more than one question unanswered and plenty of room for developing certain themes that are only hinted at in the film the rise of skywalker strays from johnsons direction and takes a different path entirely
321,3,the lack of artistic integrity plus the constant disappointments regarding each big moments climax ruins one of the most anticipated movies of the year next time just build a roadmap disney
322,4,the rise of skywalker is a messy film that contains too much plot for its own good but also a really entertaining movie that showcases why audiences love star wars
323,4,the story is messy theres enough plot to fill two movies and some of its characters need more attention but this is still very much a star wars film and will evoke many of those same old feelings of kid-like joy and excitement for those who allow it
324,3,a long time ago in a galaxy far far away the creators of the new star wars trilogy must be dedicated environmentalists because they keep recycling the same old material over and over and over
325,4,the rise of skywalker is a satisfying and spectacular end to the third trilogy
326,4,adam driver as kylo renben solo is the best thing the sequel trilogy gave us the film has way too many flaws but my fandom couldnt help to enjoy every minute of it full review in spanish
327,3,capably made but misguided in its attempts to satiate its fanbase the rise of skywalker marks some kind of end to the franchise
328,2,the last jedi took some narrative risks that didnt pay off but a follow-up that plays it safe hardly seems preferable what should feel like an epic conclusion to a 42-year-old story instead acts as proof that the franchise has lost its way
329,4,daisy ridley and adam driver are the mvps of rise of skywalker both give their all in their final performances as rey and ben solo
330,4,a noteworthy farewell to the skywalker saga with the heart and action we have come to love from the star wars franchise
331,1,a disjointed rushed and incohesive mess of fan service and b genre plotting
332,3,abrams knows when and how to play the nostalgia card without getting intoxicated with it allowing us to say goodbye to the heroes of the original saga but without removing the focus from the real protagonists of this story full review in spanish
333,2,the expected soulless capstone of a four decade saga
334,3,jam packed with action and plot the rise of skywalker gets bogged down with exposition and tying up loose ends
335,3,the rise of skywalker is filled with narrative dead-ends aborted character arcs and generic fetch quests all designed to please as many people as possible
336,4,its a shame the story isnt stronger but the rise of skywalker is still never less than entertaining  when its at its best it really does remind us why we fell in love with star wars in the first place
337,4,attempting to reverse all of the details in the prior film this hackneyed adventure finishes out the third star wars trilogy well enough but does so in a surprisingly disappointing fashion in spite of its own positive qualities
338,4,the stakes are higher the allies are scarcer and the enemies more plentiful building to a grand climax
339,4,far from perfect but offers enough action and heart to satisfy the majority of moviegoers
340,2,a messy and ultimately underwhelming experience but one that feels so desperate to please that the sense you leave with is not one of anger or annoyance but rather one of pity
341,3,its somewhat artificial a mid-term film that abruptly closes the popular space opera saga full review in spanish
342,2,the rise of skywalker is so scared of doing something wrong that by the end it doesnt do much at all
343,2,it leaves many questions unanswered a feeling of dissatisfaction deep in your stomach and a strange sense of paralysing disappointment
344,4,spoiler alert there are ewoks at the end dancing
345,4,if anything the movie plays it too safe with everything tied up too neatly but as a final chapter for these characters its a solidly satisfying conclusion
346,3,the rise of skywalker is a middling affair too intent upon pleasing the fans to rid itself of its stop-go-stop rhythm
347,2,it is by far the weakest out of the new trilogy and what should have been a triumphant end to the saga the rise of skywalker just ends in bitter disappointment
348,2,so much thrown at you with so little character reaction that it feels more like fanfiction
349,3,its like jj abrams missed the day of scriptwriting school when they taught show dont tell
350,4,this last go-round neither disappointed nor thrilled me it just exists theres always something going on and thats part of the problem theres never not something going on no pause for breath no beauty or poetry
351,2,rise of skywalker is less a film and more a series of moments strung together to please a cabal of corporate overlords
352,3,the way abrams and terrios script wrap up the entire skywalker saga in this final chapter of star wars sequel trilogy left me both baffled and yes a mixed feeling
353,4,daisy ridley and adam driver have both honed their individual characters and chemistry to a very strong place and their scenes together are easily the strongest in the film
354,3,it is trying to accomplish a lot because it has to tie up every plotline it has to involve every character it has to has to take you to every planet and so in trying to cram in all of that it feels very cursory and very rushed
355,2,i havent walked out of a franchise movie this disappointed in a whilelike was that the ending of star wars literally likewhoever has these new movies they have an uphill battle
356,2,if this new series is coming they need to take some risks and stick to itbacktracking like this does no service to the genre
357,2,it plays like a re-run warming over the familiar franchise teamsplagued by lazy writing and narrative freak-outs and its really not entertaining
358,3,star wars ends with a whimper not the royal farewell the franchise deserved
359,4,this film is a satisfying conclusion and so faithful film fans enjoy this last installment of the star wars films as we have known them
360,3,a good explosion and spaceship-filled time at the cinema but instead of a brave new direction it was the same old stuff recycled ah well still better than episode i
361,3,the changing of reys origins really hinders the kind of epic conclusion this could have been
362,3,star wars rise of skywalker made a lot of strange turns overlooked details in order to force this narrative to a predetermined ending
363,4,fundamentally a nostalgia machine drawing heavily on the iconography and narrative beats of the original trilogy but with just enough of twists that it feels relatively new
364,2,this is a submissive sloppy apology for a terrific movie this is a series apologizing for itself when it didnt need to which just feels embarrassing
365,5,the best star wars episode since the empire strikes back with as much nostalgia as new story content star wars the rise of skywalker rose to the occasion full force pun intended ignore the haters
366,3,reverts some of the brilliant subversions of the last jedi it does so in a way that feels punitive almost as if to change is an offensive notion for the biggest movie franchise in history
367,3,its hard to believe at the culmination of 42 years and nine movies that the last three would be essentially improvisational exercises by all directors concerned
368,2,kudos to jj abrams for doing something extraordinary he has made me not care about star wars for the first time ever im kind of relieved that its over because it has stopped being fun
369,4,star wars the rise of skywalker is a good tentpole movie for the holiday season and a fun star wars movie that ends on a high
370,4,powerful entertainment on an enormous scale its the most emotionally resonant star wars movie since return of the jedi in 1983
371,3,the movie is so determined to be all things to all people that it overstuffs itself becoming more of a star wars fan collage than a movie on its own terms
372,3,the rise of skywalker banks on franchise nostalgia for a finale designed to please fans while playing it safe and suffering perhaps as a consequence
373,2,neither abrams nor johnson who have more than proven their skills as filmmakers on other occasions are guilty of a trilogys failure that of course originated without a true narrative purpose full review in spanish
374,3,it all feels just a little underwhelming but john williams done-to-death score swells to hopefully convince you that you are indeed having an awesome experience and daisy ridley in particular acts her heart out
375,4,not the roaring perfect send-off we had hoped for but its still a fun sometimes exhilarating adventure and helps to remind us why star wars will live on
376,5,the pacing in the first act leaves something to be desired but at the end of the day the joy i felt watching this beloved story come to its conclusion could not be diminished the action the characters and the overall world won me over one last time
377,4,they kind of went back to the feel of the original star wars even the heavy undertones still felt fun
378,3,the crux of this dense narrative is a string of reveals that work at the cost of coherence and continuity with everything that has come before
379,3,42 years after the 1st starwars opened the final chapter of the skywalker saga rides mostly on nostalgia &amp little innovative storytelling while enjoyable and rousing at times when its over i was left with an overwhelming sense of meh
380,5,abrams is a purely visual narrator and works with functionality and integration and the result is classicist and dynamic full review in spanish
381,4,the film may feel so carefully sculpted that it lacks a sense of spontaneity or earthy honesty but its final scenes are beautifully played
382,3,it was fine and hopefully means that we can start fresh with whatever lucasfilm has on the docket for the future of this franchise
383,4,the nitpicks are small compared to what the film gets right
384,4,rey and kylos love-hate tête-à-tête remains front and center in rise of skywalker even amid some mind-numbing periphery
385,3,it was entertaining and ended up giving me more than i expected but i wast expecting much full review in spanish
386,3,a sizable amount of the narrative of the rise of skywalker is spent specifically undoing what happened in the last jedi and the result is a film that lacks forward momentum
387,4,there is plenty of action in this film and the actors do a good job the story is similar to other star wars stories with similar plot twists and revelations
388,2,it was just a lot of unexplained tension you cant just make a suspenseful dramatic scene without making me care
389,1,oh okaythey were just making things up as they went along
390,2,for every gasp-inducing jolt and hold-for-tears touching moment a sense of betrayal almost always follows
391,3,an entertaining yet disappointing finale to the skywalker saga full review in spanish
392,3,it does remain a broadly enjoyable film  at the same time it is too long weirdly paced and overwhelmingly too busy
393,5,the rise of skywalker is a near-perfect close to the sequel trilogy that drives home the message of the franchise hope
394,3,the movies fun in a superficial key-dangling kind of way but theres no substance no imagination and no care given to the characters all which are what gave star wars the cultural foothold it has today
395,4,its a very messy movie but i enjoyed it
396,3,studio bigwigs use the force to tie all the knots squeeze tears along with some giggles and awws and consequently sell a universe-worth of merchandise shame
397,4,i loved the rise of skywalker and in the same vein i loved return of the jedi its fun action adventures good fights and ties everything upwhich its supposed to do
398,4,even with its flaws the rise of skywalker gave me a precious gift the chance to say goodbyemay the force be with you always
399,2,i think the rise of skywalker is poorly directed terribly filmed clumsily edited lamely scripted a perennial problem that one and badly acted
400,4,does enough to wrap up the new trilogy but it becomes evident that its overarching narrative wasnt clearly outlined and it shows
401,4,the reason why this film works as opposed to the many editions which were overpowered by clanking machines is because of the emotional connect it creates with us
402,3,wanted it to end on a magnificent note but it didnt still it was good entertainment maybe if they had followed george lucas notes it would have been epic
403,2,the rise of skywalker makes me comprehend the hatred that haters of the last jedi felt
404,1,witless soulless and a colossally boring experience to boot
405,2,the sprint to the finish leaves the audience with a movie that has more in common with transformers than return of the jedi
406,3,what goes around comes around in the alleged final chapter of the star wars saga a so-so jj abrams helmer that shoots more toward emotion than amazement
407,2,its definitely doing something doing what feels like dozens of things really across its heaving bloated 141 minutes
408,2,characters operate on one or two wildly unsophisticated levels shouting plot details at one another or shouting reheated platitudes at one another
409,2,the stars above and beneath the fiery eyes of daisy ridley the sole beacon with promise of a story with emotional investment and volcanic result j j abrams betrays daisy ridleys eyes
410,5,no we never wanted it to end but if it had to this is as good a way as any
411,4,director j j abrams who gets so much right here could have done better
412,4,its been 42 years since the original star wars and something of a miracle that abrams has been able to channel as much of its heart and humour but he summons a lovely grace note on which to end
413,3,star wars was never authentic science fiction it was always old-school serial-style adventure dressed in sci-fi trappings with religious overtones still it deserves better than the autopilot treatment it gets here geez
414,3,rather than delivering a truly exhilarating climax the rise of skywalker merely constructs an ok one its a missed opportunity in a lot of ways
415,3,far from reprehensible the rise of skywalker manages initially to evoke frustration which evolves to a profound apathy defined by questions of what couldve been
416,3,much like the work of storm troopers any shots taken at shocking twists are missed
417,3,the rise of skywalker never feels like a film that knows the answer to the question raised in its predecessors what is the overarching story of the trilogy instead it simply frames episodes vii-ix as an act of indulgence
418,3,this movie really disappointed me
419,3,abrams took what he terrio and lucasfilm executivesdeemed the least polarizing route which was to return to the model abrams used for the force awakens and deliver a safe albeit bland wrap-up that doesnt offend anyone
420,4,with director jj abrams back and strong performances from daisy ridley and adam driver the final installment in this trilogy is emotional fun and memorable for star wars fans
421,3,the saga ends with this somewhat watchable yet entirely disappointing entry that falls well short of the high bar set by its two top-flight predecessors
422,3,disney plays it safe with a slick but predictable finale
423,2,the rise of skywalker has very little trust in its audience offering not exciting new ideas but instead only the dim pleasure of recognition
424,3,chaotic and inconsistently paced this big dose of fan service gets a few things deliciously right and a lot disappointingly wrong
425,3,cynical and pandering in all the worst ways the finale to the skywalker saga shamelessly walks back the last jedis bolder and less-sentimental storytelling choices in favour of lazy unearned fan service
426,3,both daisy ridley and adam driver rise to the challenge of their roles with the former increasingly commanding the screen while the latter exhibits vulnerabilities beneath the cracked face mask
427,4,it will take you back and the force will go forward forever
428,4,though the movie doesnt have the courage to risk anything it still finds itself in the enjoyable safe space of being a perfectly decent star wars movie
429,3,its a star wars jukebox that generates remixes and medleys of the top 250 moments from earlier installments but at no point do we hear anything resembling a new melody sung
430,3,rise of skywalker has a bumpy start but finds its footing and when it does it flies especially in the third act
431,5,as satisfying a saga conclusion as the return of the king
432,2,the pettiness is strong with this one
433,4,the rise of skywalker is a satisfying conclusion for all three trilogies
434,4,sprawling and satisfying as nostalgic memories of flying on the millennium falcon continueand at least at disneyworld the force will always be with you
435,5,star wars the rise of skywalker is a star wars film which should give fans everything they could hope for and more
436,3,it marks the return of the franchise to plodding films
437,3,a naked exercise in retrograde nostalgia that is perfectly content with playing the hits but fails to provide anything new or exciting
438,4,yet despite its flaws and familiarity the rise of skywalker draws you in mainly because you are ardently invested in the characters old and new you want to know and care about their fates
439,4,i found the rise of skywalkers attempts to congeal the disparate elements from the previous eight chapters captivating no not every choice succeeds but a bold attempt is far more satisfying than a lackadaisical effort
440,3,the rise of skywalker isnt the worst star wars film but it may be the most star wars film
441,2,the ending makes no sense it is im sorry to say an outrageously dull watch a monumental disappointment and a flimsy finale to the skywalker saga
442,3,whereas johnsons the last jedi had been daring exciting and encapsulated everything that makes star wars great the rise of skywalker brings the trilogy to an end with a bland dull and very forgettable final entry
443,4,like so many my love for this franchise will remain undiminished even if this skywalker finale wasnt the film id been looking for
444,4,its still as much fun as ever because nostalgia and exhilarating glee rule the day
445,3,episode ix is packed with star wars mumbo jumbo &amp lots of fan-satisfying cgi speaking on behalf of non-fans i thank the force its done over finished through finally
446,3,it is the definition of derivative which makes the rise of skywalker a copy of a copy faint transparent hazy on the details
447,4,a list of flaws as long as a lightsaber but theres still plenty of majesty and power as star wars wraps up a 40-year saga
448,4,star wars rise of skywalker is an exciting action-packed film that should be proud of the ending that it is serving up
449,3,george lucas 1977 original a new hope was hokey and badly written but had a kind of seat-of-the-pants magic about it it also had soul something this film utterly lacks
450,1,it is shocking truly shocking how abjectly the rise of skywalker fails even the prequels as shoddy as they were at least offered something approaching a creative vision
451,3,episode ix gets the job done but its not very nimble or inventive
452,2,a succession of decisions aimed at mitigating fans malicious whims full review in spanish
453,3,not so much a continuation but a tangent an almost complete erasure of the bold choices made by rian johnson which dared to expand the series horizons but abrams has never been able to resist the dark power of the nostalgia full review in spanish
454,3,the rise of skywalker has its issues and jj abrams plays it too safe but it remains an entertaining film that families and friends can enjoy together for years to come
455,4,clunky and bit complex jj abrams does the impossible with trying to end the star wars saga with the competent and enjoyable the rise of skywalker but it ends up playing it safe and not taking enough narrative risks to stick a perfect landing
456,3,an extravaganza of fan service exposition and leaden mcguffin-based plotting there are some nice moments though
457,4,an accomplished end to a culturally significant saga but lets hope we can now draw a line
458,4,its very much time to put the skywalkers to bed at last and free up the galaxy for entirely new possibilities the force is strong with them and all of that but its clear that theres nothing more to see here
459,4,so much of the rise of skywalker appears impossible even likely improbable until it happens and then once more we are returned to a childlike state in awe of the mysteries of the force
460,4,i dont go into a star wars movie with the fear that my childhood will be ruined if the moviemakers give boba fett the wrong color headpiece so for me the rise of skywalker dumb title by the way played just fine as a sci-fi spectacle
461,3,it is at best fine and thats really what you want in a conclusion to a beloved sometimes personality-defining series that has spanned more than 40 years right fine
462,4,if you disliked the last jedi like i did youll like but probably not love the rise of skywalker if you liked the last jedi this review might not be for you
463,4,an intense and extremely emotional experience that falls apart when analysed its not a disaster but it works better emotionally than rationally full review in spanish
464,4,a gracious exit to the sags george lucas unveiled 42 years ago the nostalgic and sentimental film isnt concerned with breaking new ground as it is with bidding farewell
465,2,the rise of skywalker is a pitiful attempt to wrap up all nine films an experience so whittled down by the corporate process that it falls completely flat
466,3,disney can move on with the real work now picking the bones of whatever ephemera we comfortably identify as being star wars and repackaging it carefully so as to 1 sell funko pops and 2 try not to piss off anybody
467,5,like the falcon in the film the nigh-impossible task of trying to please most everybody is navigated with finesse amidst the bombast of a fitting conclusion
468,5,the rise of skywalker is thrilling emotional and poignant it really is the perfect ending to the skywalker saga
469,3,star wars the rise of skywalker is an emotionally charged visually stunning and action packed close to the epic story that still manages to disappoint it pandered to fans at the expense of telling a compelling story
470,4,like a ride in the millennium falcon rickety often misguided and often seeming like its about to fall apart at any moment but the sucker sure does move fast and keep things exciting
471,3,star wars the rise of skywalker lifts our spirits just enough
472,5,thrilling charming at times cheezy like all star wars films convenient and wonderful throughout kudos to ridley for putting a daunting franchise on her back
473,3,abrams and company is sloppily pulling strings to reach their safe conclusion of sacrifice faith and convenience it admittedly works regardless of whether it resonates
474,2,theres something very off about the rise of skywalker it sort of all just happens there was no build-up no suspense theres nothing to experience and i want a star war to be an experience
475,4,star wars is and has been a very important and memorable part of my life and i must say that star wars the rise of skywalker is the perfect ending to my childhood
476,1,when we meet up with brash pilot poe hes lightspeed-skipping his way out of trouble and abrams is in much the same mode whisking you from one thing to the next before you have much time to think or feel anything in response
477,4,star wars the rise of skywalker has several mind blowing revelations &amp action from beginning to end ties everything together in a neat little bow while fixing past issues
478,2,just a shame then that reys story should have so little emotional resonance and that the skywalker saga with its 42 years of cinematic tradition should end on such a charmless whimper
479,2,this is what happens when an artist lends his voice to the pre-approved sanitized discourses of big corporations that in order to not offend anyone fails on emotionally engaging anybody full review in portuguese
480,4,lacks the outright fun and originality of the previous episodes but it achieves its goal of providing big scale closure
481,3,a somewhat bitter end to the third trilogy competent entertainment at times and a warning to disney that they have to rethink some things full review in spanish
482,2,i find its lack of faith-in its audience in its predecessors in itself-disturbing
483,3,star wars episode ix the rise of skywalker latches its existence to the past and in doing so the movie fails its own characters and story
484,3,backtracking on the bold narrative choices of the last jedi jj abrams ends the skywalker saga with clumsy appeals to nostalgia and the conservative side of star wars fandom
485,3,it tries to be everything to every kind of star wars fan hurriedly wrapping up the saga in a convenient bow but it instead often comes off as trite and sycophantic
486,4,ridley and boyega are stalwart and isaac brings wry personality to his role
487,5,jj abrams has pulled off the seemingly impossible and delivered one of the best films of the year with a final scene that couldnt possibly be more perfect bringing us a nostalgic echo of where it all started in 1977
488,3,despite the vast deepness and immense possibilities of george lucass long-ago galaxy located far far away disneys star wars is more an exercise in exhumation than storytelling
489,3,action-packed end of iconic series falls short of greatness
490,3,it isnt among the best of the star wars franchise but it has just enough exhilarating thrills strong performances impressive visual effects and a coherent plot to be a mildly entertaining harmless spectacle
491,1,the rise of skywalker could be described as a mere compendium of betrayals it commits against itself
492,4,abrams opts for completeness rather than pacing still this final movie concludes satisfyingly with a mix of joy and sadness
493,4,while the film is certainly messy and manic fans should take a breath and see it for themselves  theres a lot to like and even love in the rise of skywalker
494,3,they could play john williams ominous imperial march over scenes of uncle deadly from the muppets lobbing green goblin pumpkin-bombs at scrat the saber-squirrel i mean they literally could legally and many of us would still feel emotions stir
495,5,if it is indeed the last word on the characters and settings that have spanned 40 years of movies it is a handsome and bittersweet ending
496,4,a very good star wars film it has moments of greatness and is a fitting end to the trilogy
497,4,i loved it it was much better than cats im going to see it again and again
498,3,star wars the rise of skywalker brings the mythic cinematic saga to a rousing conclusion
499,4,there is a lot to love here especially if you are a fan of the original trilogy
500,2,sigh well at least jj abrams put the proper round antenna back on the falcon
501,4,hyperspeed action and stunning effects fuel this satisfying sci-fi adventure
502,3,rise of skywalker feels more like a disney theme park experience than an organic narrative
503,3,of course fans will want to see it whether to embrace it or criticize it but its not likely to lead to demands to continue the story of the surviving characters
504,3,however as visually impressive as the film is its the quiet moments that resonate the film wows you but more importantly it moves you
505,4,star wars the rise of skywalker is a lot of fun a genuine achievement and a great way to spend a couple of hours at the theater but once the stardust settles well probably still admit that the original trilogy is just never going to be matched
506,3,its a rushed film that force throws everything at the screen resulting in a lackluster ending that goes out with a whimper instead of a bang
507,4, giving carrie fisher top billing the big skywalker finale isnt the best film of the series but does manage closure of every current character arc topping it off with a perfect coda
508,4,its such fun full of the rackety exuberance of the now forgotten saturday morning movie serials that were an influence on george lucas
509,5,spectacularly grows its already-developed characters delivers on epic action and concludes a saga that has spanned decades
510,4,this follow-up feels like a lack of conviction from the franchise as a whole this is despite the film being just about the best possible version of a final star wars film
511,3,those hoping for surprises meaningful story arcs engaging set pieces and characters worth a damn should shrug it off the franchise that reimagined cinema and earned a second life is spinning its wheels in the coarse sand again
512,2,the rise of skywalker is like a hyperactive three-year-old filled with boundless energy and often entertaining but mostly messy and directionless
513,4,a marked qualitative step down from its immediate predecessor but it nonetheless ably closes the book on the skywalker saga for now and proves the force is still a force
514,2,it is an act of cowardice that sees a beloved nine-film saga sputter to a hugely disappointing and unaffecting end congratulations internet you killed the thing you ahem loved
515,2,the rise of skywalker captivates with its alluring special effects but it is a finale that infuriates to the extent that you literally dont care anymore why settle for a saturated and uneven reboot of return of the jedi
516,3,a mostly terrible movie with some admittedly great moments youd be better off skipping star wars the rise of skywalker and binge-watching a few episodes of the mandalorian instead
517,5,the force is strong indeed with this final chapter of the triple trilogythe film delivers on all fronts combining eye-boggling visuals with a meaty central storyline loaded with a series of resounding emotional thunder bolts its quite a ride
518,4,like most long standing franchises this installment is like marmite you are either going to love it or hate itand we loved it
519,2,even a long time ago in a galaxy billions of light years away the laws of reason would apply and these stories would be too ludicrous to be involving
520,4,theres a poetic touch to abrams conclusion that makes rise of skywalker a thematically satisfying finish
521,3,im genuinely stunned that not only did abrams learn nothing from the risks taken by johnson but also that he actively attempts to dismantle some of johnsons boldest choices
522,4,jj abrams throws everything against the way and the good news is much of it sticks
523,4,the storytelling is solid and at a time when the cgi in some films is downright embarrassing the special effects are superb
524,5,its an exciting absorbing and emotional conclusion that lifts the entire franchise to new heights
525,3,while it has some fun moments solid performances and striking imagery its simply too procedural and soulless to be anything more than adequate
526,3,you dont need a reason to see the rise of skywalker but if you did it would be daisy ridley her fierce commitment to playing rey with integrity intelligence and a total understanding of the kind of film shes in lifts her every scene
527,4,as star wars-y a movie as possible bursting with droid aliens lightsabers heroes villains and old friends to send the skywalker saga off with awell less of a pronounced limp than expected
528,2,the rise of skywalker unfortunately becomes forgettable nostalgia-pushing fodder
529,3,throughout star warsthe rise of skywalker youll keep waiting for that moment but that lump in your throat that ache in your heart that could only result from such beloved fictions becoming something more real it never comes
530,2,at best the rise of skywalker solidifies daisy ridley and adam driver as movie stars at worst it ends this narrative not with a bang but with a recycled image from a better movie
531,3,with rise of skywalker star wars limps to a close but theres still good in it
532,3,its too bad that the star wars saga has saved the worst for last
533,3,star wars the rise of skywalker is a fan-pleaser a tearjerker full of thirst camaraderie &amp woman-power for those looking for entertainment it delivers
534,4,the rise of skywalker rises above the current trilogys biggest mistakes and corrects course enough to deliver a surprisingly hopeful and optimistic finish
535,3,no amount of razzle-dazzle filling eyes and ears can cover up the glaring examples of questionable creativity and incomplete development enacted by abrams and lead screenwriter chris terrio
536,3,somehow were back to exactly where it all ended after return of the jedi those were the days
537,4,it might make no sense but the goodies get to win the baddies will always build a fatal flaw into their secret weapon and even when you die you still get to come back and pass on what you have learnt to the living
538,3,a movie that ends the series the way it began heavy on the spectacle and fan service light on imagination
539,4,the film could have ended with a bigger bang but it is still largely entertaining nonetheless full review in spanish
540,2,leave it to abrams to procure more mystery boxes but maybe this time it was one too many full review in spanish
541,4,this is a star wars movie about redemption learning to let go identity and coming home fan boys and girls will love it the naysayers should sit back and just enjoy the pure spectacle of it all
542,4,the rise of skywalker is epic spectacular surprising and most importantly brings its human stories to resolutions that brim with emotion
543,3,in terms of pure narrative its satisfying what it very rarely is is inspired
544,4,so rise will work for lots of folks but what once felt expansive now feels hermetic referring only to itself that happens sometimes even to families that once seemed so vital and fascinating to outsiders
545,4,if the central tenet of rian johnsons the last jedi was to kill the past to make way for the future the rise of skywalker is all about bringing the dead back to life
546,3,a harried and hectic affair
547,4,ok the final episode isnt perfect youll nitpick it forever with your friends but thats the point star wars isnt a movie its family were that close to it and the in-fighting about what it does right and wrong is as crucial as the love
548,4,the rise of skywalker is one last look back and while not triumphant it is a satisfying end of an era
549,3,as a conclusion to the trilogy it is undeniably messy and often frustrating but it has been made with skill and on some basic level it brings the storyline to a reasonably satisfying ending
550,3,the rise of skywalker is a mostly satisfying spectacle  its fun entertaining visually dazzling and yes emotional in parts too but as the grand finale of the skywalker saga it falls somewhat short of the mark
551,3,skywalker is expensive general family entertainment galaxies away from original and inspiring
552,2,this is the first time i feel like the force is no longer with the franchise and the darkside of corporate cookie-cutter greed has proven to be victorious
553,4,if anything the story is like a two-hour-plus highlight reel loaded with action-packed space battles laser sword duels and the return of the ultimate star wars villain emperor palpatine
554,2,it should never be so clear to audiences that something in the filmmaking process has gone so terribly wrong
555,3,the rise of skywalker does what it needs to do in 2019 to be able to survive full review in spanish
556,3,occasionally charming relentlessly entertaining and undeniably overstuffed
557,3,unnecessary exposition delivered with the pummeling speed of a tennis ball machine colliding logic lack of consequence for momentous setbacks and a sense of inevitabilitymake jj abrams capper to the original saga a disappointment
558,4,star wars the rise of skywalker is an entertaining but deeply flawed final chapter that ultimately plays it too safe
559,2,cartoonish and absurd star wars the rise of skywalker is the film that fans demanded but not the one the franchise deserves
560,1,with a couple nostalgic twists and turns this newest and very long final installment will be as memorable as the phantom menace
561,4,a mix of epic filmmaking with stunning special effects that overcome the breakneck pace of a sloppy first hour skywalker falls somewhere between the original and empire with respect to satisfaction
562,4,director jj abrams revisits worlds and echoes events from the sagas more beloved stories musical cues from john williams iconic scores heighten the moments
563,2,protagonists react in ways that never matter to us at all because they do not serve their development as characters but rather the preparation of the final climax full review in spanish
564,2,in trying to please everyone rise of skywalker struggles to please anyone
565,3,the rise of skywalker is the weakest and most unengaging installment of the new trilogy
566,2,it corrects its course in a deeply fearful way to the point it distrusts the audience
567,4,star wars the rise of skywalker is clearly fan service which is fine but so much of it hammers home that its the end it loses some of what makes a great star wars film
568,3,the rise of skywalker is a complicated blend of contradictions it lacks the balance it desperately seeks as it entertains and disappoints with equal measure
569,3,the rise of skywalker earns much of its affection with cameos callbacks and other candy that will be best savored upon repeat viewings
570,4,this saga has been told and as a long-time fan im very happy with the result the circle is now complete
571,4,in the weeks leading up to star wars the rise of skywalker the message was clear were going to answer your questions its true they did a lot of them all at once
572,3,this isnt a flawless finale to the skywalker saga but its one that will probably give the broadest cross-section of star wars fans what they want which is both a strength and a weakness
573,3,its not unlike a rollercoaster ride in that it has just enough thrills to satisfy fans but you can also see exactly where the ride begins and ends before you strap in
574,3,the skywalker saga has been brought to an end and sadly that was the only goal the rise of skywalker seemed to have
575,5,as someone who has spent most of my life loving this franchise with a career that has been often based around it i left happy
576,4,this spiritual end of an era manages to thrill us full review in spanish
577,4,fans will find more to like about the rise of skywalker than dislike and even in its faults there lies the joy of flying through a familiar universe one last time
578,3,while elements certainly shine surprisingly poor storytelling really hurts what could have been a grand finale
579,4,a messy yet satisfying conclusion star wars the rise of skywalker fails to take the risks it could have but still offers a gratifying and sentimental farewell
580,4,with another billion dollar box office movie on the line it feels as though abrams plays things safe finding ways to wind up loose ends mollifying the fan base and going for the tie rather than the win
581,3,star wars the rise of skywalker suffers the misfortune of having a director who cares more about digging up a franchises past than moving forward with an original story
582,5,a finale needs to be epic and episode ix brings about a long overdue increase of scope
583,5,star wars the rise of the skywalkerthe ultimate conclusion to a franchise started in 1977
584,2,the rise of skywalker is a bad movie and a miserable finale that serves no purpose other than to reassure at least some adult fans of the original star wars that they are still the chosen ones of the pop culture galaxy
585,2,we waited 42 years for laughable plot twists and fan service on steroids
586,4,when it comes to a franchise as near-and-dear to our hearts as star wars i think most people will be happy that reward was valued more than risk
587,4,star wars the rise of skywalker is a filet mignon of fan service a film that checks every box a few cheers will erupt a tear or two may be shed you will certainly be glued to the screen for every second
588,3,a parade of beloved characters walking through and waving as well-remembered scenes are re-enacted around them is not a story but a pantomime
589,3,saddled with the daunting task of bringing the official skywalker saga to a definitive close this ninth episode keeps switching between alternating states of good-natured incoherency and controlled panic
590,3,rise of skywalker simply feels like a shrug of the shoulders and a march into the expected
591,3,driver and ridleys performances are sensational and make this film an interesting end to george lucas beloved space opera
592,3,rise of skywalker operates as if the only cinematic tradition at its disposal hails from a galaxy far far away
593,3,for a movie predicated on satisfying fans the rise of skywalker is a distinctly unsatisfying conclusion to what had been an imperfect but mostly good few films
594,3,star wars the rise of skywalker gets bogged down in exposition and course-correcting the last jedi but does have some fun moments and fan service
595,3,the rise of skywalker ends this saga with a resounding thud
596,3,star wars the rise of skywalker has its moments but as the finale that this super-successful franchise it fundamentally buckles under fan anticipation
597,2,jj abrams conclusion to the skywalker saga is always looking to the past so it fails to find a way forward
598,3,it is disney running back to the safety of nostalgia capitulating to those who didnt like the new and releasing a movie that could only be made in a unruly attempt to please everyone
599,5,the movie snaps together like a jigsaw puzzle a series of concluding beats that seem inevitable and perfect and designed to please all parties so long as you dont dwell on the logic too much
600,3,theres no spark no joy no life if this truly is the end of the skywalker saga what an ignoble end it is
601,3,as dicey as it all is narratively abrams milk earnest thrills out of acts of unity writ large and find a corny emotional buoyancy in heartfelt reunions
602,4,a thrilling conclusion to the skywalker saga that offers action emotion and humour while finding the right balance in appealing to both old and new audiences
603,4,abrams gives the saga one last epic push delivering grand setpieces derring-do duels and a classic tale of good versus evil
604,3,its moving at times but also somewhat forgettable the nostalgia is strong even if the narrative force is weak
605,4,a thoroughly proficient if rather mechanical capstone to a series that despite its ups and downs captured the imagination of generations of movie-goers
606,4,star wars the rise of skywalker will not satisfy everyone however jj abrams does a beautiful job of restoring hope to a fan base and world that need it unless youre cynical then not even obi-wan can help you
607,3,at its best there are flashes of the old magic and even if the climax doesnt inspire a similar sense of jubilation thats fine
608,3,star wars the rise of skywalker is a fitting last movie its long maddening fun in bits fantastic in parts and so desperate to stir itself into legend that we urge it on like parents screaming at their tots in an egg-and-spoon race
609,3,in the end it feels like a film that has completely lost its nerve
610,3,star wars ix may be imperfect but it offers nostalgia hounds the space odyssey of their dreams
611,2,is this what audiences demand from franchise movies films that cater to whats comfortable and capitulates to the most unimaginative fans
612,4,chaotic at times ruined with swear words &amp scenes too scary for kids but episode ix brings balance to the force within all of us and i think thats all we can truly ask for considering the impossible task abrams was given
613,3,star wars the rise of skywalker provides an action-packed emotional &amp thrilling ending to the saga while the film takes the safer route at points its still a true a love letter to star wars
614,4,dont blame the beloved and still entertaining characters for falling further and further into the grip of the dark side of corporate sith overlords who insist on sucking the life force out of them
615,4,for those who embrace it the rise of skywalker is an earnest attempt to conclude a story that some never wanted to end
616,4,after more than 40 years the star wars series comes in for a smooth landing
617,4,the rise of skywalker rarely comes close to touching greatness but its a solid visually dazzling and warmhearted victory for the force of quality filmmaking
618,4,an enjoyable emotional end to a saga that is such a huge part of our lives may the force we be with you always
619,3,its time to say goodbye to the skywalkers and the story weve all been following for the past four decades and its not quite the going away party we might have looked for
620,3,panders wildly closing out this last chapter of the nine films that have come to be known as the skywalker saga with a story that delivers to the faithful exactly the movie they wanted
621,4,tries to fit in so much it threatens to tear apart at the seams but ultimately rises to the impossible occasion
622,3,it looks gorgeous and offers strong performances from driver and ridley in particular but ultimately the saga ends with neither a bang nor a whimper but something inbetween
623,4,it wraps up the trio of trilogies begun in 1977 in a confident soothingly predictable way doing all that cinematically possible to avoid poking the bear otherwise known as tradition-minded quadrants of the star wars fan base
624,3,if you want fan service you got it two hours and 15 minutes of safe unadulterated fan service
625,3,whats the point in introducing so many interesting new characters and then pushing them through the blueprints of old adventures
626,3,jj abrams finale doesnt just directly refute many of the ideas of its predecessor-its brand of nostalgia also feels more brazenly pandering than heartfelt
627,3,after paying homage to everything that came before this star wars ending is a too-safe landing of a massive pop-culture starship and a spectacular finale that misses a chance to forge something special
628,4,theres no way it could please every fan and it most certainly will not but i think abrams did the best he could with a seemingly insurmountable task
629,4,this star wars made me chuckle more than any of the previous ones
630,4,this is the result of a fan culture that puts the past on a pedestal the best we can hope for are echoes of our original experience
631,3,star wars the rise of skywalker does the most important thing the one thing it absolutely had to do it ends well
632,2,that galaxy far far away is feeling tediously familiar already
633,4,bringing the skywalker saga to a close abrams delivers an action-packed emotionally-charged and a fitting denouement to this trilogy
634,4,lets hand it to lucas and abrams they did it knowing full well there is no try
635,5,epic it indeed is full of magnificent set pieces sprawling space battles and incandescent lightsaber duels gripping performances and a number of truly stunning surprises
636,4,abrams brings it in for a safe landing but sometimes a bumpier ride can be a little more fun
637,4,the rise of skywalker is pure fan service for better or worse and its mostly for the better
638,4,a rousing thrilling altogether touching farewell to the skywalker legacy it scarcely could have ended in a lovelier place
639,4,those who liked the last two films will not like this one as much those who were disappointed by those will like this one better
640,4,a series of undeniably successful action and emotional sequences add up to an engaging conclusion even with a number of missteps
641,4,machine tooled by director jj abrams in his typical light speed style to please hardcore fans
642,2,it has no more use or appeal when examined in isolation than would a sparkplug or a distributor cap
643,2,a fitting end for the trilogy that felt like a needlessly tacked on addition to a story that already had its perfect ending minus the updated swap of christensen for shaw
644,2,star wars the rise of skywalker represents the plummeting of disneys artistic integrity
645,3,the end isnt as splendid as one might have wanted but you can see more virtues than errors here full review in spanish
646,3,whatever controversy jj abrams might have brewed up with his artistic choices he still captures magnificently the soul of this series
647,3,all the rise of skywalker does is wrap up everything a second time answering the same questions and revisiting the same themes
648,4,the rise of skywalker completes a saga no one sane screenwriter would have dreamt up from scratch but does so with such pluck and showmanship that the result feels strangely precious
649,3,neither the best nor the worst of the star wars franchiseand dont shed too many tears disney is going to make sure that the echoes of your goodbyes will barely have had time to fade by the time of the rollout of the next star wars story arc
650,4,rise of skywalker is far from flawless but overall its an emotional thrilling and satisfying end to the skywalker saga with plenty of surprises up its sleeve
651,4,its a flawed messy film but it recaptures the spirit of adventure i love in star wars
652,3,there seems to have been absolutely no road map as to what these movies were going to be and it shows
653,4,rian johnson did a 180 with the last jedi and jj abrams did another 180 with the rise of skywalker
654,2,the rise of skywalker eases its viewers into comfortable resignation and uncomplicated callbacks meant to pacify and not injure
655,3,it feels like a massive retrenchment  privately a rebellion seems to have been fought and lost  and only the most loyal fans will be happy about it
656,3,rise of the skywalker isnt an ending a sequel a reboot or a remix its a zombie
657,4,people will either leave satisfied or wondering what creator george lucas originally envisioned for his sequel trilogy
658,5,by the end as the twin suns set on cinemas greatest ever sci-fi series its near-impossible to hold back the tears
659,3,of course there is epic action to savour and surprises and spoilers to spill but given the long long build-up some of the sagas big revelations and developments might be a little unsatisfying on reflection
660,3,a convoluted and clumsy end to the skywalker saga
661,2,the film struggles to both honor and redeem the past before everything comes to a close
662,2,jj abrams decided to play revisionist with star wars the rise of skywalker and in doing so created a mess
663,3,despite its underwhelming ending ive enjoyed a lot of the time ive spent in this galaxy
664,4,star wars the rise of skywalker offers some interesting twists and the plot really focuses on the struggles of rey and ben
665,3,the action sequences are among the best of the series particularly stunning is a pitched battle at sea with rey and kylo ren trading blows atop floating bits of wreckage as towering waves crash all around  this entire sequence is instantly iconic
666,4,an exhilarating and emotional end to the saga full of action delight and visual splendour
667,4,spoiler-free after 42 years the original sagas story arc has come to a close and it winds up doing it in a solid if imperfect fashion and does so while marching to the beat of their own vision
668,4,it provides all the spectacle adventure and reveals you expect from a star wars finale but with so much crammed into one film its not as satisfying as it should be
669,4,star wars the rise of skywalker features some very strange pacing odd structure and is likely the least cinematic of the new era of films but still features some truly breathtaking moments
670,3,spoiler-free review if abrams has topped himself its by making a star wars film thats even more of a multiplex-filling hollywood widget than his first
671,4,the rise of skywalker is a monumental feat for jj abrams whose impossible trench run should be seen as a remarkable save by disney
672,4,what it perhaps lacks in narrative originality it makes up for with its fresh characters fun performances interesting themes and jaw-dropping action and visuals
673,5,this is easily one of the best films of 2015 and one of the best in the franchise it features an outstanding cast with some excellent performances from the new actors joining the saga and powerfully nostalgic displays from the original members
674,5,a fun action-packed table-setter for a new era of star wars it has heart emotion and a childlike exuberance that should spark a flicker of excitement in even the most hardened persons heart
675,4,everything feels familiar but new to a most satisfying degree
676,5,i cried i laughed and as the film concluded i couldnt help but smile knowing that jj had done what many were terrified he couldnt do he brought star wars back to life
677,5,episode vii will serve as an excellent letter of introduction so that the new generations who have not watched star wars are interested in the saga and approach the previous episodes with a new vision full review in spanish
678,5,with all the heart and soul of the series we love its undoubtedly set to be a favorite for the years to come
679,4,a successful star wars movie isnt really about clever story or spectacle its about something much harder creating a feeling
680,4,blowing away any memories of the prequels the force awakens for once lives up to and perhaps even betters the hype
681,5,theres good news for star wars fans the initials in director jj abramss name definitely do not stand for jar jar
682,3,from the blaster fire to the star destroyers crossing star-speckled skies to the rubbery alien faces populating desert communities so much of this undertaking is recycled
683,3,its an entertaining and spirited film that proves once again that the force is still with jj abrams
684,4,star wars the force awakens is the perfect homage to the original trilogy
685,4,its an entertaining rollercoaster that does a lot of good things  i just wish the production took more of a chance to create its own identity the reward wouldve been worth the risk
686,4,its a one of those sequels that makes you buy the ticket to see it again full review in spanish
687,4,its enough to make a grown fan cry
688,3,it doesnt really do anything wrong but that is not the same as doing everything right
689,4,the force awakens is a brilliant return to star wars that evokes extreme nostalgia and led to a spark that led onto one of the best entries in the skywalker saga
690,4,yes the force awakens cribs from previous incarnations of the franchise but the true power lies in the heart of the characters both ridley and boyega pop off the screen
691,5,star wars the force awakens more than makes up for the sour taste of the prequel trilogy
692,4,the force awakens checks all the correct boxes sets the stage for a new series of films
693,5,with its nostalgic tone great dialogue and simple-yet-effective story the force awakens is a strong comeback for the franchise
694,5,the star wars franchise is totally back and i cannot wait to dive into the rest of this trilogy
695,5,thank you jj abrams
696,5,basically if you dont think star wars the force awakens is as good as the original trilogy thats almost certainly on you and not the film
697,4,hums with the constant energy of a film trying desperately to please and while it doesnt always hit every note perfectly it hits them with such gusto that it makes up for its faults
698,5,its an end product that caters to the generation who grew up with the original films and inspires them to fall in love with a series all over again while their kids discover it for the first time the force is strong with this one
699,5,director jj abrams has crafted a film that is entertaining for non-star wars fans and is chuck full of lore and new story for the die hard fans
700,5,its more than another blockbuster this is a powerful nostalgic joyous regeneration
701,4,this thing is an entertainment orgy of galactic proportions a fun-filled planet-hopping visually breathtaking adventure that gets the next generation of star wars stories off to a good start
702,4,it has some unengaging and familiar story beats that hamper what is otherwise a great return trip to the galaxy far far away
703,5,a perfect balance of impressive action and special effects some nice humor and several scenes that pack unexpected emotional punch
704,5,the force awakens is easily better than all the prequel films however i wouldnt rankit higher than anything in the original trilogy except maybe return of the jedi
705,4,a fun remix if you will of what we love about star wars it doubles down on what works and safely doesnt reinvent the wheel
706,5,theres no reinventing of the wheel here but an authentic enthusiastic and well-observed continuation of the universe
707,3,having the presence and dramatic lineage of three characters the prequels werent afforded the luxury of accessing han leia and luke adds some gravitas to proceedings
708,4,jj abrams is the right choice to helm this sacred film franchise and present a whole new litany of continuing adventurous narratives for a new generation of star wars personalities dipping their tenacious toes into the force of goodness
709,5,the force awakens isnt the best film of the year but it certainly is one of the best based purely on entertainment value
710,5,it was never going to be easy following up the original star wars trilogy was a difficult task for its creator george lucas and his prequel trilogy was met with a lot of criticism and backlash
711,4,the nostalgia factor  is done with great poignancy adding the emotional beats the film needed to be accepted by the old guard
712,4,the force is very strong with this one
713,5,incorporating old and new concepts and characters together blends wonderfully the style feels like george lucas golden touch
714,5,the star wars film we needed a palate cleanser funny full of action and lots of feels this new entry achieves great balance between nostalgia and novelty full review in spanish
715,4,abrams has done a lot more than rebirth this series he has renewed it with hope for the future
716,5,the storytelling is top notch its a carefully-crafted dance of nuance that balances a bit of everything
717,5,it succeeds by managing to be spectacular thrilling and as star wars past meets star wars present and future unexpectedly moving too
718,4,even if tfa is mostly fan service ill take it
719,3,the new cast is brilliant i still want to see where episode viii goes but im in no rush to see it again as a standalone film
720,5,thank the maker the galaxy still has life in it
721,5,ive been sold on the rich possibilities of these new movies im letting the force in this time
722,4,the force awakens takes its legions of rabid fanboys very seriously throwing them meaty bone after bone
723,4,star wars the force awakens gives new life to a franchise of hope resilience courage and family thats been missing from theatres for far too long
724,4,its a big star wars universe out there and abrams has just made it bigger again with this mix of fan boy homage and a fresh and quirky vision of his own
725,4,the force awakens is fun im not sure that its great  but on the heels of the prequels well maybe fun is all we really need
726,5,as the most anticipated film release that i can remember in some time the force awakens has some big shoes to fill and fill them it does
727,4,star wars the force awakens honors the series and takes it in exciting new directions both the millennium falcon and millennials it would seem are in good hands
728,4,what weve got here is a film that managed on the first try to turn the engine over in a car that has been collecting dust for 32 years now they didnt drive it anywhere so we cant tell if it was worth the effort
729,4,what is the force and jedi-ism in star wars it refers to the ability of a high-level martial-artist-knight to use supernormal abilities science has proven 6 of them
730,2,its fan fiction writ large making it clearer than ever that george lucas is star wars with his voice gone all thats left are tinny reverberations of movie history
731,5,a trio of writers led by lawrence kasdan put the fun and fast-paced serial adventure back into luke skywalkers galaxy and just as importantly they give us new characters that we care about
732,5,the return to that galaxy far far away that audiences have longed for
733,5,this is more than just a nostalgia trip star wars is back and it feels beautiful
734,5,jj abrams has done the impossible he has created and recreated a star wars movie and made it look and feel like a star wars movie should funny sad exciting and enlivening it is a definite and an absolute must-see
735,4,please no more sermons about midichlorians and the force lets get those light sabers crackin and crack they do
736,4,humour and heart are prominent amid the breathtaking action
737,4,abrams plot mirrors that of a new hope but deliberately so it will charm old fans win many new ones and make everyone an awful lot of money
738,5,the force awakens is truly a stunning exercise in large-scale filmmaking a beautifully-assembled picture in which abrams combines a magnificent cast with a marvelous flair for big-screen sci-fi storytelling
739,5,great in the awe-inspiring tear-provoking way that only films built on generations of dreams can be great it taps not into what the original films were but what they meant to audiences how they made us feel
740,5,no matter what else the force awakens gets right and it gets plenty right the most important thing is that it feels like star wars in a way that the prequels never did
741,4,the film has an excellent rhythm that gives you but a few minutes to recover from all the action before plunging you right into another battle full review in spanish
742,4,its thrilling fantastical and feels like star wars
743,4,the force awakens is more of a bridge than a completely new era but it successfully lets audience live again in a galaxy far far away
744,4,if whats contained is ultimately the planting of seeds that will continue growing two four or forty years down the line i suspect this franchise is in its best-ever state
745,5,the spectacular star wars the force awakens provides a new hope for future generations of moviegoers
746,3,video essay this latest installment of fandoms favorite mongrel pet is a poorly paced macguffin-chase plot ginned up with groan-inducing spoonful doses of pro-war imagery and its attendant rudimentary vocabulary
747,4,as a one-off the movie might seem like a little miracle a fresh take on nostalgia not too different in tone from last years delightful turbo kid but stretched out a hard crust of cynicism is apparent just beneath the sugar-dusted surface
748,4,as long as the viewer does not need to contend with jar-jar binks or a pod race any star wars film delivers more than a tickets worth of entertainment
749,1,it is easy to assume that lucas sold the franchise to the xerox corporation because the new film is nothing more than a weak photocopy of the 1977 classic and its 1980 follow-up
750,4,a canny crowd-pleaser of reversals replays and reveals
751,4,the creative team is to be commended for a franchise resurrection that catches the spirit of what knocked the socks off a prior generation of galactic film fans epic entertainment epic movie event
752,4,its precisely what you expect nothing more nothing less and there isnt anything wrong with that
753,5,the force awakens is an exciting nostalgic powerful and moving film that is capable of generating accelerated heartbeats and knots in the throat full review in spanish
754,4,while star wars the force awakens gets temporarily bogged down taking us back to the world that we left in 1983 it introduces us to the new and exciting torch-bearers of the franchise
755,4,its enjoyable in the moment but leaves us little to chew on to dream on
756,5,a thrilling outer space epic breathing new life into a once flagging franchise
757,4,this was not a movie made under the weight of calculated strategy it was given life by those who took immense pride in their association and sought to enhance an established legacy with grand enthusiasm
758,4,its like abrams put episodes iv v and vi in a blender its an act of love no doubt about it  but it lacks any image of its own that is truly iconic
759,4,theres no end in sight the force has awakened
760,5,jj abrams and his crew have restored the shine to our beloved storythe force is awakened indeed
761,3,the tendency for the narrative to repeat the beats of a new hope though perfectly logical in a saga founded upon the constancy of the heros journey comes off as pandering fan-fiction
762,4,this is very similar to the first star wars film but it isnt as family friendly hope and optimism are lacking in this reboot what it lacks in optimism it makes up for with hype having been promoted along with every product known to man
763,3,secret threads on social media are already picking their nits and debating theories its going to be a tough wait to see what happens next
764,5,springs to life around a terrific new star
765,4,what abrams delivers here is still a pretty good start to this new trilogy but you cant help but think how great it might have been if they had done their own thing and given us something new
766,4,abrams plays it safe but its a good kind of safe because for the first time in ages the star wars saga has personable leads
767,4,it does exactly what it needs to be a crowd-pleaser in that regard but whether it breaks any new ground  not so much
768,4,i didnt mind the many nods to the original two movies  at least they nick story points from the right ones
769,4,its beautiful to look at brilliantly acted breathlessly exciting frequently amusing yet capable of delivering some emotional gut-punches that take it into the dark territory inhabited by the empire strikes back
770,4,the force is still here
771,4,this film is a particularly chilling portrait of the relationship between father and son full review in spanish
772,4,the light saber is drawn the battle stance is set and the force is most definitely strong with this one
773,5, a complete fan-service that combines the exciting storytelling and use of practical effects from the original trilogy with the crisp vibrant color palette and clean computer graphics of the prequels
774,5,appealing both to a new generation of viewers and fans of the series since the beginning this 30-years-later sequel to 1983s return of the jedi is a thrilling adventure
775,4,the force is strong in this spirited sequel this is the movie that star wars fans have been waiting decades for
776,4,thats whats so impressive about the tricky balancing act abrams has pulled off with the force awakens hes made a movie thats simultaneously gripping and a huge release we are in good hands at last
777,3,a money grab in which wunderkind jj abrams choses to go where george lucas has gone before by basically repeating plot points even lines from the original trilogy
778,4,i found myself listening to a chorus of spontaneous gasps cheers laughs whoops and even occasional cries of anguish whats really surprising is that many of them were coming from me
779,4,and just like that the scars of 16 years and lesser trilogies were magically washed away weve seen much of whats onscreen before but abrams brings a fresh energy to pacing and performances that reminds us of the joy of watching star wars films
780,4,dishes out familiarity without apology and arranges it in such a way that even as we recognize the patterns and beats it feels fresh and invigorating and lest we forget whats really at stake here fun
781,5,an exciting winner for fans and box office
782,5,jj abrams thrilling sci-fi adventure marks a rebirth in exciting galactic entertainment
783,4,its loaded with nostalgia
784,5,the film knows its dealing with iconic elements of pop culture recognizes them as such and shows enormous joy while using them full review in portuguese
785,4,does not disappoint
786,4,ill cut to the chase yes it lives up to the hype jj abrams has created a film that stays true to the original series while updating it for a new generation
787,4,three or four moments of astonishing beauty and three or four more that will make you want to cheer fox 29 philly
788,5,i dont think ive ever been so completely satisfied with a film considering the insane amount of build up and the wild expectations i had its almost miraculous that a film could live up
789,5,the movie delivers in every conceivable way on every imaginable level star wars the force awakens is a phd level course in getting it exactly right
790,4,as a stand-alone movie its enjoyable but not extraordinary as a continuation of a franchise it needs a warning under construction sign
791,4,obviously it helps to know the old characters but han luke and the rest are cultural legends that even the young new fans will know about them
792,4,maybe the new sequels and spin-offs can be more adventurous but the force awakens had me smiling reminiscing and critiquing all at the same time it hits all the marks without any real surprises
793,4,the force awakens written by abrams lawrence kasdan and michael arndt offers enough salutes and nods to the original trilogy to please those fans while introducing interesting and likable characters that will entice new followers to the series
794,4,epic star wars sequel delivers great performances action
795,5,this is why i love star wars this is why i love movies
796,5,after george lucas put is to sleep with episodes i ii and iii the force is definitely awake the most fun ive had in a theater this year
797,4,so go out get your ticket and join in all the hullabaloo confident this time you wont get jar-jar-ed
798,4,the familiarity feels good feels comfortable chewie were home as han solo says but it also hems in the new films ability to really be its own thing
799,5,ultimately star wars the force awakens wins us over because it is about hope
800,5,chewy im home
801,5,there are no midichlorians there are no fart jokes no sequences that blatantly scream i am a video game concept no gunguns and its all wonderful
802,4,its a huge amount of fun although whether the self-referential nature and the did-we-surprise-you-there style of plot reveals stand the test of time remains to be seen
803,4,the force awakens rarely stops moving yet its action never seems excessive thats because combatants and targets always remain clear instead of fuzzed up by the hyper-speed visuals hack action directors use
804,5,this movie stands proudly as an example of the magic that once was routine in movie theaters it makes kids of us again and allows us to discover that going to the movies can indeed still be a special event
805,4,a film that fans of the old movies will relish but one that looks bound to capture the imagination of a new audience too
806,4,all points converge for a dramatic emotionally charged finale and a lightsaber duel up there with the best of the first trilogy these fights work best as an extension of the story not over-choreographed showcases for stunt workers
807,4,star wars the force awakens easily lives up to its mammoth hype but its not flawless nor a better film than the original trilogy it is a non-stop action film with a shotgun pace like plugging the cotton candy machine directly into your face
808,4,its everything the kid in us goes to the movies for  marvelous adventure that leaves us surprised scared and euphoric
809,4,this episode brings warmth back to a franchise more frozen than a dead tauntaun lets hope the second and third movies continue the thaw
810,5,from old joys to fresh twists this is a unique blockbuster experience that celebrates the franchise whilst also expanding it
811,4,the action scenes are excellent the special effects are superb and theres good doses of humor suspense and drama all along the way
812,4,we can sense the film establishing itself as the backbone for a new narrative cycle its a promising start
813,4,abrams and his fellow writers have gone deep to get back to what star wars was and promised to be force seeds it well with nostalgia blood ties and galactic prospects for the next chapters
814,4,as a critic this is a good movie as a fan im devastated full review in spanish
815,4,abrams and company know exactly where your emotional hanging curve balls are and they hit every one of them out of the park
816,4,jj abrams delivers a love letter to the star wars universe one made not only as a hardcore fan but as a filmmaker who studied the source material thoroughly full review in spanish
817,4,makes you remember the brilliance of a new hope and the empire strikes back but also makes you curious for what may come with episodes viii and ix full review in spanish
818,4,jj abrams bring the franchise back to life with a perfect mix of nostalgia and innovation full review in spanish
819,5,a thrilling ride from start to finish full review in spanish
820,5,relative unknowns daisy ridley a legitimate star in the making and john boyega sort of pick up where the likes of leia and han left off
821,5,its amalgam of old and new a thrill ride that satisfies in its own right as well as in assuaging the fears of fans
822,4,force brings fun back to star wars
823,4,the dialogue is punchy the actors are engaged and human the action sequences and special effects complement the plot rather than make up for it the story rockets along
824,4,some with no memory of being swept away almost forty years ago will follow strong new heroes and villains for those old enough now and young enough then to have childhoods consumed by this stuff its a satisfying new turn in a near life-long tale
825,4,the fun of the force awakens comes from visiting an old friend and finding that little has changed the excitement is that great performances from all four new leads means its a strong foundation for whatever comes next
826,4,finally im able to watch a new chapter of the star wars saga and actually look forward to the next film and man thats nice
827,4,the story is compelling the acting is great the technical aspects are solid but its hard to escape the idea that the film is a remix of something else an attempt to rework story elements that felt more original elsewhere
828,3,as a nostalgia trip that knows exactly what die-hard star wars fans want and then layers in some memorable new characters the force awakens is exactly what it needs to be an old-school saturday afternoon sci-fi matinee writ big
829,4,abrams and company have brought star wars home again by reigniting the soul spirit and sense of wonder of the three original films
830,4,the most wildly anticipated and furiously hyped movie of the millennium is finally here and the collective exhalation of relief can be heard around the globe if not the galaxy fans can rest easy jj abrams star wars reboot is a triumph
831,5,charts a path to a future that refuses to get mired in nostalgia yet all the star wars notes are here remixed into a glorious new arrangement
832,4,episode 7 of stars wars is an enjoyable retread full of great new young actors and returning favorites
833,4,the force awakens reboots the franchise right  so why does it feel like a star wars remake more than a sequel
834,4,the best disappointing movie ever
835,5,a rollicking adventure that brings back pure escapism epic visuals and boldly designed heroes and villains making the return to a long time ago in a galaxy far far away all the more satisfying
836,5,a near perfect star wars film that regular fans and fanatics alike have been waiting for but it suffers by slavishly sticking to the tropes from the original and doesnt strive to go off script
837,4,even before han and chewie appear and what a wonderful reveal it is the force awakens is undeniably a star wars movie
838,4,content merely to continue the storyit answers the question where are they now but has no new thoughts or insights regarding the stories we know
839,3,the force awakens is thrilling and fun but fans of a new hope might have more than a hint of déjà vu
840,5,john boyegas finn the reformed stormtrooper with a heart of gold whoops in delight throughout jj abrams star wars the force awakens who could blame him
841,4,a swift entertaining and comfortable star wars movie one that will feel familiar to fans of the original trilogy
842,5,an action-adventure film for the ages and bonus not an annoying ewok in sight
843,4,dramatically the film does pull some great aces from up its sleevethe film also proves what a lot of star wars fans have long suspected that the best thing that could happen to star wars would be to take george lucas out of it
844,5,new planets and old faces original characters and veterans to guide them this is a franchise reborn not reinvented
845,4,the prequels dont stand a chance this is as good as fans could have hoped for and better than we deserve
846,4,jj abrams homage to the first star wars film the one that took our collective breath away the one that defined our childhoods takes fan service to new heights which is not necessarily a bad thing
847,5,the best most thrilling star wars movie to date
848,4,the long wait is over and the news is good the force awakens heralds the new dawn you hoped for
849,4,a good piece of adventure cinema that never feels like it had a chance of being a great piece of adventure cinema
850,4,star wars 7 the force awakens is a welcome comeback for the franchise and fan love will be enough to propel most viewers past its flaws
851,4,unquestionably the best star wars movie weve seen in 30 years and an undeniably entertaining ride but one certainly not without a collection of narrative flaws
852,4,story and spectacle are what count and abrams delivers the latter with deftly realised reprises of favorite scenes and thrilling set piece
853,5,i dont want you skimming paragraphs trying to find the sentence where i say its good so here it is star wars the force awakens is a spectacularly good movie
854,4,a fast-paced good-spirited thoroughly approachable action movie that grabs and keeps your attention from first frame to last
855,4,though the plot is overly familiar abrams hits all the right beats and leaves us hungry for the next chapter
856,4,the first thing i thought as the credits rolled was that i cant wait to see it again
857,3,it exists less as a meaningful extension of its world than as a fan-service deployment device
858,4,when the force awakens gets going you couldnt ask for a more propulsive joyous or witty star wars film
859,5,kids and adults alike are going to eat this thing up and come back for seconds and thirds probably in the same weekend if they can score tickets
860,4,its a relief to see a big splashy movie that actually maintains a sense of childlike play
861,4,make no mistake the new film delivers it is in no way disappointing except in its conformity
862,4,abrams is a hyper-competent entertainer and a fan with an astute understanding of what made the original trilogy appealing
863,4,even if this adventure spans the galaxy fords presence tends to bring things down to earth
864,1,what abrams has done is to remake star wars a new hope tweaking it for the passage of time improving on the acting the effects and the dialogue and tossing in some bits from its sequels
865,5,we get to spend a lot of fun andor dramatic time with fords solo while ridleys rey and boyegas finn give us a pair of dynamic new heroes to follow in future star wars episodes
866,4,anyone who enjoys the other movies particularly episodes 4 through 6 should be perfectly satisfied with the direction of the franchise
867,4,star wars the force awakens is simple and highly entertaining a rollicking adventure that avoids anything about trade federations or blockades
868,4,the force awakens is half reboot half remake and all fun
869,5,jj abrams and team brilliantly merge the old and the new into a star wars that soars on every level han solo is back but it is daisy ridleys rey that is the heart of the force awakens shes a keeper
870,4,from the opening crawl to the ending credits its the star wars movie we waited decades for and it sets the stage for even bigger better and bolder adventures to come
871,4,the force awakens works quite well considering it is lumbered with an unshakable neurosis throughout
872,3,jj abramss sleek feverishly hyped episode seven injects the moribund series with humor and humanity but relies too much on remixed bits from the original trilogy
873,5,its a brilliant next step in the saga and it leaves you wanting more which is exactly what it needed to do
874,3,the nostalgic callbacks are so insistent that they can stop the narrative dead like when some real drama is about to go down but everything pauses so we can have a meet-cute with c-3po even the main villain comes off as some emo darth vader fanboy
875,4,its a solid space opera spectacle with enough nostalgia to overpower even the most hard-hearted child of the 70s and 80s but it relies a little too much on recycling old plot elements
876,3,for the first hour or so of the force awakens director j j abrams gives you everything you hoped for and even exceeds your expectations
877,5,to millions of moviegoers the force is with us once again and that is good
878,5,with the care of a true fan abrams melds the old with the new bringing in fresh elements while reintroducing the characters and themes fans have loved for nearly four decades
879,4,exhilarating if highly derivativean enjoyable throwback that is largely content to replicate its models rather than taking the narrative in any significantly new direction
880,4,director jj abrams is like a kid trying to cram in as much playtime as possible before bed his enthusiasm is infectious almost overwhelming
881,3,it is not a little disheartening to see this new star wars installment not blazing its own path but rather chasing its tail and rehashing its former glories for our approval
882,4,jj abrams rescusitates the series far more in keeping with the original trilogy than their creator george lucas did with episodes i-iii the saturday morning serial feel is back
883,4,a fun if uneven return to a galaxy far far away
884,5,its script is ludicrous riddled with coincidences and a fealty to existing text that a less forgiving person might call lazy yet i cant wait to see it again
885,4,a return to the levity of the original trilogy ford is as good with zingers as he is with blasters
886,5, star wars feel like star wars again 
887,5,star wars the force awakens is the star wars sequel we have been looking for a classic adventure that harkens back to the glory days of 1977s star wars and 1980s the empire strikes back
888,4,this is a movie you dont want to end despite a final shot that is one of the greatest in the franchises storied history abrams has righted the ship the star wars saga is back and we are gleefully in it for the long haul
889,4,star wars the force awakens is exactly the movie you want it to be
890,4,an exhilarating ride filled with archetypal characters with plausible psychologies melodramatic confrontations fueled by soaring emotions and performances that can be described as good period rather than good for star wars
891,4,it gives us what we want and what we want is more of the same
892,4,harrison ford and peter mayhew playing han solo and chewbacca are flat out terrific delivering one-liners slap-stick and heart which transcends mere nostalgia
893,4,star wars has come roaring and soaring back with a fabulous bountiful richly rewarding payoff for anyone whos been waiting patiently or otherwise
894,4,a star wars film by fans and for fans
895,5,an episode iv for a new generation is only as good as the reminder to the old of why they fell in love with these movies to begin with
896,4,this is the beginning of something its a farewell to the old guard and a welcome to the new as such its hard to begrudge the film its plethora of callbacks repeated plot line and heavy exposition
897,4,thrilling exciting and dazzling with a heartbeat underneath star wars the force awakens delivers everything you want in a star wars movie its worth waiting in line for and lives up to the hype
898,4,a triumphant return to form for the franchise the best of the films since the empire strikes backits also a rousing introduction to new characters who will likely carry this world forward through two more planned episodes and assorted spinoffs
899,4,baldly trades on its predecessors but with enough artfulness and genuine affection to count as its own unique experience
900,4,director jj abrams has delivered the episode 4 fans were looking for in 1999
901,5,whats really surprising too is just how emotional it all is more than just nostalgia the force awakens earns its tears star wars is back in a big way as c-3po might say thank the maker
902,4,slick and stylish the evolution of the world of star wars is fully realized with sumptuous sets vigorous and energetic cinematography and impeccable sound work
903,4,ridley and boyega make a sizeable impact amidst the cacophonous sound and merchandising fury capturing the vulnerability and anguish of conflicted characters haunted by murky pasts
904,5,fans will get goosebumps right from the start as the scrolling summary to bring us up to date without a single mention of tariffs or bureaucratic squabbles
905,3,perhaps another director will pick up the elements that abrams left scattered about imbue them with some any kind of subtext to give us some real poetry
906,3,i enjoyed the seventh star wars film more than any since the empire strikes back and much more than yes reader i was there for this newspaper reviewing it the now 38-year-old saga start-up
907,4,star wars episode vii  the force awakens marks the star warsiest movie since return of the jedi a fun and fantastic blend of old memories and new blood old enemies and new friends old actors and really old actors
908,5,what abrams has done is find and return the ingredient crucial to the original three films in the franchise that was sorely lacking in the second round fun
909,5,the force awakens isnt just one the finest movies of 2015 its the best movie of the year full stop
910,5,not for nothing but john williams score is absolutely perfect as usual and it makes every one of the action scenes come to life all the more
911,4,go see the force awakens with an open mind and without expectations of the same lightning being captured again in the same bottle it is at the end of the day a movie and its a pretty good one
912,4,even if it isnt the greatest star wars film ever its almost certainly the most affecting of them all
913,5,at the risk of committing blasphemy the force awakens is the best of the seven star wars  followed closely of course by the 1977 original
914,5,ford especially earns his money with this one but as fun as it is to see han solo back in action the newcomers like ridley take center stage launching subplots that should be fun to watch in ensuing installments
915,5,the best thing that can be said about the force awakens is that its classicist in the way of a well-executed neo-soul record crackling with familiarity without bowing to the altar of history
916,4,if you were to make a list of the essential ingredients of a star wars film you would find almost all in jj abrams wake-up call to this sleeping giant of a franchise
917,4,the force awakens has all of the strengths of the original trilogy and none of the weaknesses of the prequels
918,4,star wars the force awakens is actually probably objectively the best star wars yet and would be held up as untouchable had it come first
919,5,it is precisely the star wars movie that you want it to be this is the one you were waiting for you may be waiting just as intently for the next one
920,5,with the force awakens abrams got to build a whole new universe on a base of returning favorites no character is stronger though than rey daisy ridley who is the central player in the new story
921,4,the force awakens is satisfying on its own no half of a hunger games movie here but it also sets the stage for these new characters to go off on some great adventures in episodes to come
922,4,the force is still with us my friends 38 years later its hard to believe it ever left
923,3,the force awakens feels like a genuine star wars movie with well-executed battle scenes light comic touches and a warm feel for its characters
924,3,some may thrill with delighted recognition at the spectacle of yet another primal duel fought over a great void others though may know that the real test of myth-making lies in an ability not to repeat but to reinvent
925,4,if hollywoods going to extend the most famous movie myth of the past 40 years the force awakens seems a worthwhile way to do so
926,5,this undoubtedly is the movie that fans wanted the movie that fans deserve
927,5,star wars the force awakens returns the iconic sci-fi franchise to a glorious place that hasnt been seen since ewoks danced off into victory in return of the jedi 32 years ago
928,5,the seventh installment in the series started by george lucas in 1977 is the best star wars sequel yet and one of the best films of 2015
929,5,the force awakens pops with memorable battle sequences gives us chills with encore appearances by stars from the original trilogy and introduces more than a half-dozen terrific next generation characters
930,4,when the force awakens ends it feels bittersweet simply because you so badly want to get to the next chapter so yes the wait is over but now a new waiting game begins
931,3,the force awakens has succeeded where it counts most in creating a cast of characters that viewers can spend the next several years rooting for especially the spirited resourceful heroine at its center
932,4,the film is a state-of-the-art throwback both retro and post-modern in its self-awareness it doesnt just know that its operating in the long shadow of a classic it hardwires that understanding into its own dna making legacy a prevailing theme
933,5,you will like this movie no thats not some kind of jedi mind trick accompanied by a vague wave of the hand its a educated prediction grounded in  well the force if you must know and dont tell me the force doesnt work that way
934,4,pleasingly this isnt a film that takes itself too seriously with the seriously cute bb-8 supplying plenty of humour with his electronic beeps and chirps and no end of playful references to the original trilogy crammed into the 135-minute running time
935,4,jj abrams has perfectly captured the spirit of the original trilogy with great characters terrific action set-pieces and a surprising amount of humour
936,4,abrams has served the fans and first-timers exceedingly well
937,5,ridley boyega and isaac make equally charismatic heroes and driver is surprisingly effective as the sinister ren star wars the force awakens is commercial american moviemaking at its best may the force be with it
938,4,the formula more than the force was with abrams he was wise enough not to mess with it
939,4,is the force awakens equal to the original trilogy fans will have to face facts such unique magic can never be recreated the new star wars films must create a universe of their own  and theyre off to a promising start
940,4,the force awakens is a triumph of escapism and the most exhilarating film yet in this mighty franchise it is the magnificent seventh
941,3,sacrosanct and on steroids  but comes to life here thanks to the magnetic performances of ridley and boyega
942,5,from the very first line of the films opening crawl it is apparent that jj abrams michael arndt and lawrence kasdan have pushed the series back onto the right track
943,5,the new heroes of the force awakens are brightly drawn occasionally surprising and an endless pleasure to spend time with
944,4,the seventh film in the star wars saga is still just a movie but its a fabulously entertaining and beautifully crafted movie nonetheless
945,4,they got the job done with the force awakens and while abrams pays more homage than he rightfully should he also introduces the most exciting characters star wars has seen since not going to lie lando calrissian and lobot
946,5,this is a triumphant reboot of the biggest film franchise of our lifetimes and fully earns its place as the soon-to-be biggest film of all time
947,4,while the force awakens belongs to the younger generation ford dominates its throwback element like a true ahem force of nature
948,5,rest assured fans you wont have to complain how abrams further ruined your childhood this is everything we initially loved about the franchise and exceeds expectations
949,4,this film fits into the franchises much-debated canon and is the best installment since the empire strikes back a long time ago in a galaxy far far away
950,4,rey and finn though feel fresh and new
951,4,from the iconic opening crawl through the wordless last frames of star wars episode vii the force awakens director jj abrams steers pop-cultures most beloved sci-fi saga in an exhilarating new direction
952,4,a fun polished space odyssey that embraces the appeal of the originals
953,4,star wars the force awakens is the movie it was promised to be with great new characters a respect for the original trilogy and a strong understanding of what makes this franchise click with fans
954,4,its nice to see ford fisher and hamill but the force awakens really belongs to ridley boyega isaac and driver
955,4,its slick its smart and you feel like youre in safe hands the whole time jj abrams should breathe a massive sigh of relief hes done it hes made one of the good ones
956,5,ive searched my heart and i know it to be true for me at least star wars the force awakens is my favorite of the franchise episode vii is star wars no 1
957,4,when the first star wars film was released in 1977 nobody had seen anything like it almost 40 years on the trail it blazed is now so well traveled its on every intergalactic tourist mapthat makes abrams feat all the more impressive
958,5,star wars the force awakens might just be the best film of the last 30 years or so
959,5,the force awakens re-awoke my love of the first movie and turned my inner fanboy into my outer fanboy there are very few films which leave me facially exhausted after grinning for 135 minutes but this is one
960,4,star wars the force awakens is good not great but far better than not bad solidly confidently good
961,4,the star wars we love is back  with humor comes heart and its easy to forgive a couple plot points when a movie has this much heart
962,4,itll make you cower at the site of kylo rens blazing red lightsaber itll make you whoop with glee at the roar of poe damerons x-wing
963,4,its an entertaining but ultimately lightweight bridge between the classic movies and disneys apparently never-ending slate of upcoming feature films
964,4,star wars episode vii the force awakens is a special kind of blockbuster wondrous and thrilling and not in the least hampered by cynicism dont be surprised adults if watching it makes you feel like a kid again
965,4,star wars the force awakens is a fun return to form for the series
966,5,the force awakens leaves us wanting more which is exactly what it should do impressive abrams most impressive
967,5,the star wars movie for people who dont like star wars pure old-school pleasure
968,4,the force awakens steers the franchise back to its popcorn origins its not a bible its a bantamweight blast and thats just as it should be a good movie nothing more
969,4,the best new star wars film in three decades and one of the most satisfying films of the year
970,5,masterfully marrying new with nostalgia this is the one weve been waiting for
971,5,the rollicking space-opera spirit of george lucass original trilogy you can safely forget the second trio of cynical tricked-up prequels emanates from every frame of jj abrams euphoric sequel
972,4,spoiler-free can be dimwittedly obvious and self-plagiarizing with little of real-world consequence and less thats new to say but its still a fun-filled adventure at the movies
973,4,when the force awakens is really cruising its a terrific piece of pulp adventure cinema packed with memorable characters vicious lightsaber battles some very smart visual concepts but its narrative shortcomings can be quite frustrating
974,5,star wars the force awakens is some kind of miracle as it works on every imaginable level
975,5,the force awakens is meant to honour the past and lead us into a new narrative future it feels like what people feel a star wars film is supposed to feel like the force is strong with this one
976,4,yes it helps that the core group of original actors has returned but its more the energy humor and simplicity of direction that has been recaptured its the overall vibe
977,4,the director jj abrams recaptures the pop lightness that made the first star wars seem simultaneously eternal and effervescent
978,5,this seventh movie is a humongous piece of cinema  all that a sequel should be and more a nostalgic homage to the 1977 original coupled with intergalactic warp-speed panoramic blockbuster action and a new heroine in the form of daisy ridleys rey
979,3,while i evidently find the films issues harder to overlook than the majority of audiences theres no denying the entertainment value or technical prowess on display
980,5,rogue one looks amazing the effects are stunning the action is energetic the nostalgia is delightful theres the right amount of humor and it tells a good story
981,3,diverting and well-made though the picture may be rogue one ultimately serves no real purpose beyond fleshing-out established material
982,4,an incredible cast in a well executed star wars film the representation is beautiful and that ending memorable
983,4,rogue one ultimately connects episodes iii and iv in ways we could have never imagined a film that can be seen in theaters and after you can go home and watch its sequel instantly in the comfort of your own home
984,5,its much more than a simple spin-off is one of the highest chapters of the entire saga it takes as its starting point a simple dialogue from star wars episode iv- a new hope and transforms it into a heroic 2-hour requiemfull review in spanish
985,5,the set-pieces  particularly the finale at an imperial based on the tropical planet scarif  have a grittiness to them that we havent seen since that battle on hoth
986,4,rogue one comes equipped with the subtitle a star wars story but let it be known that this isnt your fathers star wars your mothers star wars or even your own star wars
987,4,felicity jones impresses in this thrilling addition to the star wars franchise
988,4,rogue one isnt just the prequel you never knew you wanted its also quite possibly almost almost as good as a new hope itself
989,3,genuinely fresh roles are getting harder to dig up in this universe
990,4,you might have no idea how big the star wars franchise really is and still be able to love this particular movie devoid of any expectations
991,3,star wars as a franchise is not perfect but rogue one gave us something different in its standalone approach it reinforces the simple notion of hope and change and the true cost of conflict and war
992,4,its indicative of where this franchise is going actually let me correct that its indicative of where this franchise isnt going
993,4,this feels like grown-up star wars
994,3,its a space opera that despite having tiny periods of digital surprises it runs out of steam full review in spanish
995,4,the film is fun its enjoyable it was exciting at times even but something felt like it was missing or off
996,4,unlike any other franchise a new star wars movie can be considered a life event i can pinpoint where i saw each one of the prequels and episode vii make it a special one the movie does its part
997,5,the visual splendor of rogue one often gets ignored but few images can haunt an audience like the death star coming up over the horizon
998,4,overall gareth edwards and his cast and crew have something about which to be very proud
999,4,if you take it for what it is worth rogue one isnt a terrible film and it did fill in some of the holes in the plots of episodes iv v and vi nicely
1000,5,another triumph for lucasfilm after the force awakens rogue one a star wars story isnt necessarily the best instalment of the franchise but it doesnt disappoint and delivers everything a fan could want
1001,5,dark gritty dirty brave and a star wars story worth telling
1002,4,rogue one is a thrilling action movie with real stakes believable characters and some stirring emotional beats
1003,5,rogue one kicks it into hyperdrive a little over halfway through and it never really slows down after that in fact it continuously manages to get better as the movie progresses
1004,4,its filled with easter eggs but not fan fiction its also fun but not iconic and its universe-expanding but not defining rogue one is a worthy spin-off even if it still has to sit at the kids table during franchise holidays
1005,4,feels like exactly what we always wanted from a star wars prequel and for better or worse its exactly what we got
1006,4,the pace may be more slow-cooked and its tone may be bleaker than were used to but so much hits right on target and makes the force strong with this one
1007,3,this is a passable action movie and thats about it
1008,4,in clear rebellion from the saga franchise edwards has taken star wars in a glorious new direction
1009,2,i know that for the next few years at least ill see fewer and fewer interesting engaging stories and more and more interchangeable shells surrounding interchangeable explosions
1010,5,rogue one a star wars story is a full and engaging addition to the star wars canon the sort of striking cinematic experience that is reminiscent of the reasons we came to love the star wars in the first place
1011,4,the first half felt like all action and no real character development by the end of the film i found myself caring for the rebel team as they undertook their last mission
1012,5,chirruts abilities borderline the trope of portraying disability as a superpower but thankfully writers avoid offense by giving him a personality and character development that has nothing to do with his eyesight
1013,5,this is the prequel we were looking for
1014,5,an engrossing tale of war showing the hearts of those who fight it fans of all ages are likely to find a resonant story worth telling
1015,3,it may be the best suicide squad movie of 2016
1016,4,what rogue one does differently than its predecessors is turn the black-and-white dichotomy of the empire and the rebellion on its axis
1017,2,when rogue one is following the cool and different edict thats when its awesome
1018,1,the nadir of this films cynical marketed traipse through the iconography of its franchise is in the preposterously pantomime mythologisation of darth vader
1019,5,it really puts the wars of this franchise front-and-centre like never before and what it lacks in depth and polish it more than makes up for with spectacle and grit
1020,4,its a mixed bag of a star wars movie so its basically par for the course
1021,4,its loyal to the franchise without ever being slavish and it bends the established story at just the right angle giving the sagas central conflict a new kind of life
1022,3,rogue one a star wars story is the worst theatrically released star wars yet i know that many will lambast the work that george lucas did in this prequel trilogy but i have a soft spot for his vision with those films
1023,4,for those who grew up loving star wars but have wanted the film series to grow up and become more nuanced and dangerous along with them rogue one does this while still squarely existing within the design and narrative parameters of the universe
1024,4,this film brings something slightly different to the star wars universe while at the same time giving us a lot more of what we already know and love
1025,5,great battle scenes heartfelt characters and the knowledge that there can only ever be one make this a real gem amongst stones that have at times struggled to shine
1026,4,a surprisingly dark yet brilliantly action packed and fun anthology film
1027,4,while we dont have the same nostalgic attachment to cassian bodhi and jyn thats what unburdens rogue one giving it a freedom to tell a story on its own terms
1028,2,when the film slows down enough for the dialogue to sink in we realize that the story such as it is has been cobbled together from all previousstar wars films combined
1029,5,can i just say that i liked rogue one a star wars story better than the last four star wars storieseven the force awakens which was the top grossing film of 2015
1030,4,the action in rogue one is extremely well-staged and exciting and its fun to see its small connections to the larger star wars universe
1031,4,the ending is filled with both a bittersweet tragedy and hard-fought victory  a new hope is earned and so is this films place in the upper echelon of star wars lore
1032,4,jyn erso felicity jones provides the franchise with another strong independent woman
1033,4,it is now a great starting point for someone new to this franchise to quote one of the familiar lines from this space opera the force is strong with this one
1034,4,this is star wars for adults well-loved characters die the violence is gory by and large and the atmosphere is more on the lines of the french resistance during world war ii than the light-hearted thrillers that george lucas films were
1035,4,rogue one certainly doesnt hit all its marks but it surely hits enough to keep holiday audiences happy particularly as its story begins to merge with the one we discovered all those years ago
1036,4,this is meant to be a standalone spin-off from the star wars movie universe but it feels like episode 35
1037,4, a reason to hit theaters this holiday season
1038,4,rogue one a star wars story sets the benchmark of how a good standalone film can be made without ruining a tight story with unnecessary sequels
1039,3,ultimately rogue one is a movie for star wars fans
1040,3,rogue one starts wearing out its welcome at about the hour mark and theres another 75 minutes to go the movie lumbering like those at-ats feels like it stomps along forever
1041,4,hopping from planet to planet battle to battle the fast-paced narrative means theres little time to flesh out everyone involved yet even if their characters remain sketchy several make vivid impressions tudyks k-2so is a scene-stealing delight
1042,3,rogue one a star wars story has gorgeous visuals including an excellent production design and great special effects but when it comes to the narrative theres a lot left to be desired thanks to a screenplay that refuses to develop the characters
1043,5,more proof that diverse casts can actually lead to big box office numbers
1044,4,an origin story that stays true to its predecessors while crafting its own unique identity
1045,5,a hugely entertaining film in which all of the elements fall into place so seamlessly that it cant help but make the vast majority of recent would-be blockbusters look even lamer than they already do
1046,4,in the first star wars film in 1977 heroism is rewarded literally in the form of a medal but here heroism requires extreme sacrifice that ultimately lethal distinction is a key to the difference between previous chapters and this sidebar
1047,4,though its certainly worth a look rogue one is a minor star wars story
1048,4,a deep cut for star wars fanatics
1049,4,fans of the star wars filmsand dont be ashamed to admit it if you are one will see a more complete expansion of the mainline story and a lot of visual excitement
1050,4,since rogue one slides neatly into the preexisting plot of the original star wars trilogy it doesnt feel glaringly imitative of it as the force awakens did
1051,3,a thrifty footnote in the star wars saga
1052,3,rogue one is fine if youre a star wars fan
1053,4,technically sophisticated and emotionally engaging
1054,3,for a sublime third act rogue one is a resounding success for the perversity of slavish desire for performers to be as interchangeable as video game characters this star wars dude does not abide
1055,4,this is a star wars film for fans not casual observers it has plenty of nice touches that bring back fond memories of the original and may well be the best star wars films since the original trilogy
1056,4,the first act is the frenetic embodiment of the hollywood machine but the final 30 minutes is a rousing climactic battle on the empires home turf
1057,4,its already apparent that disneys plans for star wars are cause for excitement
1058,2,rogue one isnt taking any chances its desperate to ensure a seamless transition with episode iv as if this constitutes a meaningful end in itself
1059,4,yes
1060,4,starts off slow but boasts a fantastic third act and a very satisfying ending a worthy addition to the star wars canon splice today
1061,3,its pretty routine but star wars faithful should find it plenty good enough director gareth edwards keeps things moving well enough for the modest needs of the script
1062,4,when rogue one is good it is very good when it is bad it is well not prequel trilogy-bad at least
1063,4,the star wars expanded universe kicks off with this entertaining yet far from flawless prequel to a new hope
1064,4,while there is some humor in the movie i would have liked more of that and less of the several scenes featuring characters stoically waiting to die i cant really blame them for their fatalistic outlook since the empire is indestructible
1065,4,the first star wars story is a success
1066,4,those with patience will find that its second half is fully rewarding with its epic battles and grand conflicts between good and evil bearing most of the weight of the astronomical expectations that are now part and parcel of the franchise
1067,5, makes many of the other star wars films feel inferior can we postpone the numbered movies and just tell these little big stories for a while
1068,5,really this is the prequel that should have been made 10 years ago instead of that dreck that george lucas defecated into the world
1069,5,rogue one slots satisfyingly into the canon pushing the franchise in a slightly more edgy contemporary direction without causing a disturbance in the force
1070,4,rogue one might not be as grand a space opera as its predecessors but certainly holds its own
1071,4,jones mendelsohn and forest whitaker as a militia leader stand out in a strong cast
1072,2,a routine cgi extravaganza primarily interested in creating a pavlovian response every time someone or something familiar appears
1073,4,disney may be squeezing the franchise to the fullest but as long as it continues to produce star wars movies of this quality i doubt many people will complain full review in spanish
1074,5,you never knew donnie yen whomping stormtroopers was something you needed in your life until you saw it happening
1075,3,these star wars movies are pretty much the same story each time nowadays this one has new names for basically the same characters played by different actorsthe same bad guys how many times can they make the same movie and get people to pay
1076,3,not just a dull but an oppressive experience being force-fed a corporate product a film that never comes alive with none of the characters properly developed none of the relationships gelling the very adventure formulaic
1077,4,a cleverly conceived one-off that forges its own identity with a new set of characters a contained storyline and a kind of stripped-down tone and visual approach free of the grandiosity of the series
1078,4,edwards appears to have elevated what could have been simply a cash-in into something that feels essential even magical it has the distinct smell of victory
1079,4,rousing rogue one a worthy entry in the star wars saga
1080,4,a well-crafted and thoughtful story drives rogue one in a sandbox that provides a perfect blend of modern action and classic star wars style

1082,4,rogue one a star wars story meets expectations the fears of thousands of fans can dissipate this is a worthy product full review in spanish
1083,4,in addition to giving us exactly what we should expect from our blockbuster event-movies rogue one means weve only just begun to explore this galaxy far far away
1084,3,the stars are gone much of the spirit has been lost leaving only a lot more wars so this is a space-faring big-screen computer game with hoards of stormtroopers
1085,4,even if its not great it is a quality sci-fi film that wont disappoint its fan base
1086,4,explosive action interesting characters and a compelling story make this stand-alone movie in the star wars universe a winner all the way
1087,4,if youre one of those who factually but wrongly derided the force awakens for sticking too close to formula this is undoubtedly the star wars film for you
1088,4,fans will be happy
1089,4,rogue one is at its best when it explores the relationship between the characters at ground level they are a scrappy lot with a lot of heart
1090,4,jyn represents a new breed of almost gender-neutral hero dogged tenacious resolute and in a world as bleak as this one thats what amounts to hope
1091,4,its characters are largely new which means the movie can do with them as it wants it isnt hemmed in the way most prequels are
1092,3,rogue one does a brilliant job capturing the look and feel of star wars but narratively its a footnote and some of the creative choices are baffling
1093,4,much of rogue one is a push-me pull-you with george lucas original films
1094,3,rogue one feels more like a movie with star wars stuff in it than an actual star wars movie
1095,5,rogue one is set a long time ago in a galaxy far far away yet feels more immediate even prescient than any hollywood film in recent memory
1096,4,rogue one is the star wars film that as an adult who grew up with the originals ive always wanted to see full review in spanish
1097,5,rogue one sure pulls no punches and it is a gritty war picture that perfectly captures a galaxy ruled and impoverished by the tyranny of the cold and clinical empire
1098,3,with all the aerial dogfights armored combat vehicles grenades flame-throwers and snipers rogue one feels like a film for those who think that most star wars movies are insufficiently like world war ii flicks
1099,4,ben mendelsohn is satisfyingly nasty as the films principal villain and while id like to have seen a little more of mads mikkelsen an ensemble cast of proper actors gives the film authenticity and grit
1100,2,an attempt to squeeze one more movie out of a used macguffin
1101,3,i believe devoted star wars fans will be thrilled with the intense rogue one i liked it okay
1102,5,it ranks among the series best  just below a new hope and the empire strikes back episodes iv and v and just above the force awakens
1103,4,from a visual standpoint its stunning as the production values are a real knockout plus the battle scenes are really well executed that said the plot is not always that engaging
1104,4,this off-shoot is a heck of a fun science-fiction film and the last third of the movie is a wild epic battle
1105,4,suffice it to say if the filmmakers had actually put up this tangle of a screenplay to k-2so to rate his opinion it wouldnt have been encouraging
1106,4,maybe its modesty is the key to the success of rogue one that it doesnt seek to build on the mythology of the other seven films but simply fill in a gap
1107,4,epic but violent adventure offers diversity role models
1108,3,the 213 length and cookie cutter characters and events suck the life out of an underwhelming story great effects but the force just isnt with this one
1109,4,this standalone prequelsequel takes a few beats to get going but once it does star wars fans are taken on an intense thrilling ride
1110,4,trading emotion and depth for sci-fi magic and bombast rogue one is the start of a darker more grown-up direction for the saga and i applaud it
1111,5,theres genuine fun here but the humor is cynical the heroics are tinged with regret and its all delivered with a cold smack of yes political relevance
1112,4,rogue one a star wars story is thrilling harrowing and slightly rushed a beautifully shot film that could have given its characters more time to develop
1113,5,the best star wars movie ever by a longshot
1114,4,i had a bad feeling about this but rogue one proves it belongs in the star wars universe
1115,5,stylistic touches and new characters make rogue one seem fresh which also invigorates the ongoing franchise
1116,4,we must trust this series a series that made us fall in love with scruffy-looking nerf herders trigger happy fuzzballs and pessimistic droids we must trust the force
1117,4,by the note-perfect closing moments rogue one has transformed into a richly rewarding experience
1118,4,as we rebels prepare to fight the empire of trump the film is more pertinent than ever
1119,4,the force is with rogue one because by looking back it helps carry the star wars saga forward
1120,4,rogue one is technically a spin-off but it is a rip-roaring do-or-die adventure yarn in the best tradition of the space-age saga
1121,4,gareth edwards has expanded his story to its maximum while keeping it lean raw and morally murky outdoing the force awakens in the most satisfying installment since the empire strikes back
1122,5,a seriously rousing action film with a riveting cast of characters and a surprising willingness to embrace even the darkest elements of storytelling
1123,3,the film isnt as excting as episode vii but there are a few reasons to get excited about it the incredible stages death troopers and a pair of cameos that serve as anchor to this universe full review in spanish
1124,2,the good news is that edwards effort to make a storm-the-beach war film produces a tense third act that earns most of its big moments and also justifies much of whats come before
1125,5,as a prequel it brings depth and strength to the existing canon and rogue one a star wars story will probably leave fans wishing it could have spun off into a franchise of its own
1126,5,its a film that should further the genuine sense of excitement surrounding this particular franchise revival while standing as something of a classic in its own right
1127,4,the force is strong in this spin-off
1128,4,rogue ones establishes its own identity while fitting perfectly in the star wars universe full review in portuguese
1129,3,were used to the characters in this series existing primarily as archetypes the characters here though barely qualify as archetypes
1130,5,this is the star wars film to be excited for since a galaxy far far away has never looked as promising as it does now rogue one a star wars story is everything the force awakens should have been and then some
1131,4,certainly there is pleasure in revisiting a favorite place youve been many times before but its not an event film for the first time it really does just feel like an episode
1132,3,audiences once packed theaters to gawk at the future now its to soak in the past the emphasis is on packing in as much nostalgia as possible and tersely editing it together to resemble a film
1133,4,rogue one finds a way to forge its own path
1134,4,a film with amazing performances and an absolutely memorable ending where action emotion joy and sadness embrace in a totemic spectacle full review in spanish
1135,4,edwards pushes the saga out of its comfort zone to offer a complex look at the universe created by george lucas making it truly feel diverse and complicated full review in spanish
1136,3,sadly that felicity jones isnt a standout as rogue ones lead speaks to how more effort seems to have been spent on fan service than character development
1137,4,a fun ride that repeats the star wars legacy without really adding to it
1138,4,its an enthralling go with little pops of surprise and revelation that should please nostalgically so
1139,4,action-packed and glorious in its engaging and often times exotic dimensions of storytelling is absolutely stirring
1140,4,this is a movie made for fans
1141,4,rogue one spins star wars into a whole new orbit
1142,4,star wars wars is such an immersive world heavy in lore and esoteric facts that being able to balance fan service without scaring off the casual moviegoer is no easy feat rogue one a star wars story manages to do exactly that
1143,4,its a real shame the character side of things is so weak because otherwise this is a strong addition to the franchise
1144,4,k-2so has all the good lines im not sure if its such a good thing that the best character in a sci-fi movie is a robot but then again the best character in 2001 a space odyssey was hal and that film wasnt half-bad
1145,2,like an imperial star destroyer it starts off slow and somewhat clunky but by the time the mind-blowing third act arrives its all a fan can do not to stand up and cheer
1146,2,often it looks dingy and cheap speed of action ought to compensate but when the action is standardised chases-through-space turgid and repetitive that doesnt compensate for anything
1147,4,rogue one is sometimes as admirable as it is enjoyable but it also has some glaring problems that are clearly holding the movie back from reaching its full potential
1148,4,this prequel delivers more levels than the death stars elevator
1149,4,one of the most exhilarating in the series a film with a real sense of how to tell a story and tell it well
1150,4,familiar star wars action scenarios are revisited revamped and revitalised courtesy of bleeding edge effects and genuine love for the material
1151,4,rogue one does a great job of walking the fine line between being a star wars film and not feeling like any other star wars film
1152,3,a highly entertaining messthe kind of loopy stumblebum spectacle you get when state-of-the-art visual effects collide head-on with the erratic sensibilities of a resolutely mediocre director and the crushing need for a studio to meet a release date
1153,4,it also works as its own stand-alone film one which despite some lumpy pacing in its first half turns out to be possibly the best star wars war film of the bunch
1154,4,in short this movie is what the star wars prequels should have been and thats meant as high praise indeed
1155,5,the resonant and entertaining rogue one is about the persistence of hope and faith in the darkest of hours as we stagger to the end of this epically turbulent year the movie is all but guaranteed to strike a chord
1156,3,efficiently madebut it comes across as an assembly-line product an elaborate but fairly conventional action-adventure movie too dependent for its effect on references to earlier entries in the series
1157,4,thats what people love about these star wars movies right we get older they stay the same
1158,4,dark gritty and heavy on the nostalgia what rogue one lacks in dialogue it makes up for in action
1159,5,the performances in this film are among the best the franchise has seen this isnt a film of supermen its one of everyday people trying to justify morally and practically their roles in the struggles against an overwhelming evil adversary
1160,3,the film comes home strong with large-scale warfare feats of great daring and sacrifice and acres of dead storm-troopers
1161,4,above all else it is on a technical level that rogue one truly excels allowing edwards to conjure a sizeable number of intergalactic spectacles that are as stirring as they are stylish
1162,3,imitation they say is the highest form of flattery if so the makers of rogue one flatter the heck out of its predecessors
1163,3,gareth edwards tries to generate suspense by using well-worn movie cliches that display a lack of imagination and point to the flaws of telling this tale in the first place
1164,4,rogue one is still an achievement every other star wars movie has only ever had the responsibility of telling part of a story this manages the whole thing in one go
1165,4,a fun outing if also a derivative one donnie yen and the droid steal the film from the leads
1166,2,theres a comfort in being in the star wars universe and you immediately feel a renewed affection for it upon re-entry but a star wars film shouldnt rely on its star wars-yness
1167,4,rogue one might not necessarily be a film that was needed but once the credits roll you realise how much you desperately wanted it regardless
1168,4,rogue one is one of the best films of our favorite space saga and will undoubtedly delight the fans even on the verge of a nostalgic and involuntary tear of emotion full review in spanish
1169,4,rogue one is like its heroes it is flawed in some ways but its still well worth the wait
1170,3,it suffers like many blockbusters from too much spectacle and not enough truth but its greatest sin is that it feels dull insipid and underwhelming despite a plethora of loud action scenes and dazzling visual effects
1171,4,enhances as well as annotates the star wars mythos making the story we thought we knew in a new hope richer and more urgent
1172,3,in previous star wars movies one side wore black hats and the other wore whitehere thats not the case for some this is a selling point for me its close to a deal-breaker
1173,3,theres nothing to sink our teeth into especially when we already know how it ends theres no suspense
1174,4,admittedly this can be viewed as simply another rehash of old stories and themes but hash is rarely this tasty
1175,5,a star wars story for the ages
1176,4,the movie the prequels should have been perfectly captures the spirit of the original trilogy and delivers a genuinely thrilling star wars film
1177,3,rogue one is star wars for hard core fans who felt left behind by the prequels but its got little to offer casual viewers beyond competent uninspired thrills
1178,4,of space dust joni mitchell and the force a visually splendid dramatically stirring journey spanning both yesteryear and tomorrow
1179,5,the force is not only well and truly with us again it seems as if its never been gone
1180,4,an almighty triumph the best-constructed and most fun star wars flick since the empire strikes back the force is truly strong with this one
1181,4,it was always one of 2016s most anticipated films and it doesnt let down the legions who have been waiting for it
1182,4,gareth edwards has crafted the most satisfying star wars film since the empire strikes back
1183,4,while the principal characters are new edwards ensures there are enough significant nods to the star wars universe to enchant fans
1184,5,has the urgency and battlefield heroism that great war movies are made of its incredible stuff all around
1185,4,rogue one a star wars story is a fine stand-alone film and one that will have you anticipating episode viii which is just a short 367 days away
1186,4,coming from someone who is not really a star wars freak i have to say i was impressed this could be the best one yet
1187,4,there is always the danger with a film of this high profile to expect or want it to over-deliver sadly though understandably rogue one just doesnt do that
1188,4,rogue one accomplishes what fans have wanted to see for a few decades now making darth vader scary again
1189,5,its the trio of tudyk wen and especially yen who steal the show each bringing to life characters that will likely go down as three of the best ever to grace a story set in the star wars universe
1190,5,this is a gorgeous and immersive film
1191,3,new diverse actors from around our world breathe new life into prequel that just entertainingly barely satisfactorily repeats the tried and true themes and expensive action
1192,4,this spin-offprequel has the same primitive lived-in emotional loopy lets-put-on-a-show spirit that made us fall in love with the original trilogy
1193,4,of the three sidekicks yens rueful but deadly martial artist leaves the best action impression
1194,4,rogue one somehow delivers on almost all of its weighty pre-release promises whilst at the same time besting the force awakens for sheer spectacle
1195,5,a hugely enjoyable film and an impressive sign of things to come this is the perfect film for a star wars fan
1196,4,its an experiment that mostly works but there are moments when its clear that the task of finding new areas of star wars to play with is a bit too much for director gareth edwards to handle
1197,5,we already knew this was going to be a thrilling epic but i had no idea of the emotional punch it would pack
1198,4,i enjoyed this scrappy little movie the second consecutive one to feature a female heroine
1199,3,it offers more details of interoffice politics among the squabbling factions of both the empire and the rebel alliance than probably anyone but a mid-level manager cares for yet you generally feel youre in good hands
1200,2,star wars movies have been dazzling infuriating heartbreaking silly witty convoluted gripping and overblown but until rogue one a star wars story i dont think dull was the most appropriate adjective
1201,4,rogue one has well-placed humor inside jokes aliens droids and creepy cgi renderings of two key star wars characters all set against the backdrops of mind-bending production designs and hypnotic visual effects
1202,1,its a downer its morally tangled the characters are as depressed as the scenario and michael giacchinos music cant make it better
1203,4,disney refuses to waver from what makes star wars matter the battle between good and evil where can we send the thank you notes
1204,4,if youre not a fan rogue one may not be the revelation that the force awakens turned out to be but it wont have you wishing for your own personal death star either
1205,4,while its great to see danish actor mads mikkelsen placed into star wars lore as a catalyst for the rebel alliance the british jones lacks the fire daisy ridley brought to chapter vii
1206,4,lucasfilm has outdone themselves theyve delivered a thrilling installment that embodies the best of star wars rogue one surpasses every expectation
1207,5,what results is a poignant powerful paean to the star wars universe set in a world where the best thing you can hope for is hope itself its a perfect and complete standalone but it changes everything
1208,4,if the force awakens was an exercise in giving star wars fans exactly what they want rogue one does its best to show them what else there is in the galaxy
1209,4,the new characters are nicely fleshed out particularly joness jyn whose initial cynicism gradually morphs into a steely resolve its seed planted by the memory of her father but watered by the idealism of the rebellion
1210,3,a classic adventure story and worthy spin off of one of the most popular sagas of contemporary cinema full review in spanish
1211,5,at its best rogue one is scrappy and epic in equal measure aware of the potential to be glorified fan fiction and using exactly what it needs from the star wars mythology to create a vibrant stand-alone adventure
1212,4,rogue one is definitive proof star wars is back baby
1213,4,when you realize where its all been heading  ending on a moment thats as transcendent as anything in 40 years of the franchise  youll be so so happy
1214,3,rogue one features stirring action scenes vivid characterisation and one or two truly eye-popping explosions nonetheless what it lacks is any real originality
1215,4,doesnt break the mold in terms of franchise formula and its an enjoyable installment in the star wars canon however its not much more than that
1216,4,much more than a mere sideshow in the star wars saga these rebels build on a brilliant legacy
1217,5,star wars has been filled with political commentary since the first in 1977 and this film is no different  i enjoyed this more than the force awakens
1218,5,as the kickoff of a new phase of star wars on the big screen rogue one is a smashing success showing there is a lot more to this galaxy than lightsabers and skywalkers
1219,4,a perfectly satisfying summer fun film untidy and a little cliché at first but eventually ends up standing out because of its humor and its subversive energy full review in spanish
1220,5,rogue one is pure unbridled star wars
1221,4,gareth edwards venture into a galaxy far far away is the star wars film we never knew we needed its a triumphantly thrilling serious-minded war movie that is incalculably stronger for the fact that its not the first chapter in a new franchise
1222,4,rogue one is a bright light in the star wars canon
1223,4,edwards has created the rare star wars property that can be appreciated as a film and it is about as violent and downbeat as star wars gets on the big screen-more downbeat than the empire strikes back in fact
1224,4,lets face it rogue one is the best star wars movie in a long long time full review in spanish
1225,4,towering like a stick-man over the rest of the cast k-2so provides most of the laughs in this portentous voyage into that same old galaxy far far away
1226,3,in the end this hardening of the franchise seems likely to alienate both the fans and the uninitiated
1227,4,in between all the crash bang and wallop there are also some truly odious villains with vader as sinister as hes ever been and australias ben mendelsohn clearly relishing his role as the human-cyborgs psychotic chief enforcer
1228,4,the movie works even if you only have a passing knowledge of the star wars universe or havent seen the original in years but there are several enjoyable callbacks and some eye-popping surprises for die-hard fans
1229,4,the force is strong with this film  a perfect fit as a prequel to a new hope
1230,3,rogue one represents an unobjectionable exercise in franchise extension its fine itll do for now
1231,3,even though the film is much grungier and more realistic than all the previous chapters this corner of the star wars universe still is a thrilling place to visit
1232,2,its too grimy and relentlessly bleak to be any fun and lacks the substance and drama to be taken seriously
1233,3,it tries so hard to be an epic masterpiece with self-important speeches and an insanely outsize orchestral score that it ends up a laughable parody of itself
1234,5,rogue one a star wars story is the best star wars movie since 1980s the empire strikes back
1235,4,a solid film with its own vision and tone yet undeniably still a part of that wonderful galaxy far far away
1236,5,if the franchise can continually pull off blockbusters with the same level of creative energy and the proper amount of reverence as rogue one does theres every reason to expect greatness for years to come
1237,3,for this lived-in universe rogue one features some distinctly cgi distractions revisiting classic characters and resuscitating them 2016-style its crude and unnecessary in a film thats otherwise fairly sturdy if unremarkable
1238,5,this is exactly what edwards always said he was going to make a star wars war film people die and tears will be shed anyone who thought it would be watered-down should think again
1239,4,rogue one stands on its own an entry that is at once part of the star wars franchise obviously but also separate a tougher grittier film
1240,4,the action sequences both on the ground and in space are rousingly staged but the losses incurred in those sequences are sobering the stakes in the star wars rebellion are high indeed
1241,3,when the universe expands in this way it actually makes it seem so much smaller
1242,2,it is a brave attempt at making a new kind of star wars movie but seems all too eager to express its fealty to the source material without thinking up any ideas of its own
1243,4,intriguing and richly diverse characters a suspenseful plot an amusing sidekick and a very satisfying answer to one of the most persistent questions from new hope
1244,4,rogue one a star wars story succeeds far more than it doesnt and has some rich characters and terrific performances specifically tudyk and yen to go along with the beautiful visuals and intense action
1245,4,rogue one a star wars story does exactly what it is supposed to do by incrementally expanding the star wars universe that we already know
1246,4,hard-core fans who thought episode vii was a dumbed-down rehash will bask in an action-packed film that refuses to spoon-feed information mind you thats the same reason why the casual fan will be disengaged
1247,4,this is a whole new stable of characters operating on the fringes of the world we know by heart when you think about it thats pretty exciting and it opens up a world of cinematic possibilities moving forward
1248,4,aside from k-2sos killer lines wonderfully voiced by the indispensable alan tudyk most big satisfactions in this big big movie come from references to star wars adventures youve loved before
1249,5,it stands alone as the best star wars entry since 1980s the empire strikes back yes its that good
1250,3,just once id like to see a star wars film and be wowed by seeing something completely new and fresh i didnt hate it however it commits the crime of being underwhelming and unoriginal
1251,4,rogue one is groundbreaking for the star wars franchise a rousing side story that blows the doors wide open for future installments of the series that it stands on its own as a slam-bam action thrill ride is a bonus
1252,5,as pure retcon-meets-thought experiment rogue one scratches an itch that has been tickling since that initial screening in 77
1253,4,rogue one is worthy of standing alongside the original trilogy not only in terms of quality but in creativity imagination and inspiration
1254,4,rogue one is a more-than-worthy prequel which is a first in the star wars universe
1255,3,rogue one is better than the prequels by a long shot but after the high bar set by last years episode vii the force awakens simply being better than the prequels isnt good enough anymore
1256,3,the chaps are heroic the villains are dastardly all thats missing is burton and broadsword calling danny boy
1257,4,despite its darker tone rogue one feels cosily at home in the star wars universe and is crowded with the kind of imagination-tickling details the franchise thrives on
1258,3,technically deft but emotionally cold
1259,3,even an underwhelming star wars is a pretty decent star wars but rogue one misses a real chance to turn the familiar into something remarkable
1260,4,a little bit guardians of the galaxy a little bit dirty dozen in its mass wartime slaughter and a pretty good time once it gets going
1261,3,doesnt move the bar on what it means to be a star wars movie in any significant way
1262,5,a much bolder addition to the franchise that makes risky deviations from the winning formula that those bold decisions pay off is impressive most well you know the rest
1263,5,rogue one is a movie crammed with fan service but when fan service is done this well theres little to complain about and much to adore
1264,4,very good and often great a true cockle-tickler for fans hoping to stoke the excitement of their inner nine-year-olds
1265,5,rogue one a star wars story upends lucas familiar saga by zeroing in on the compelling lives outside the orbit of the skywalkers theres one word that accurately conveys what this movie does to the star wars universe rebellion
1266,4,the ultimate star wars fan film its short on whimsy but when it gets going theres enough risk-taking and spectacle to bode well for future standalones
1267,4,rogue one manages to succeed as both super-nerdy fan service and the first entry since the 1977 original that will satisfy people who have never seen a star wars film
1268,5,this story isnt going to be like any star wars movie youve ever seen
1269,4,its a flawed movie but a good one sometimes more interesting as a concept than a story but oh what a concept
1270,5,rogue one is the best star wars film since the empire strikes back
1271,5,rogue one might trade heavily in nostalgia but its bold enough to take risks and will leave you stirred fired up and raring for more
1272,3,this movie is about the journey not the destination and the journey is about as exciting as a long drive down the florida turnpike
1273,4,rogue one is a return to form and the star wars movie fans have been waiting for since the 80s
1274,3,despite a galaxy of potential and a number of killer moments gareth edwards star wars spinoff feels painfully forced
1275,4,if nothing else gareth edwards combative hard-working installment answers why the death star was so easy to destroy in the first place
1276,4,its variations on a theme are muscular and adroit this is another really entertaining fantasy with fan-fiction energy and attack
1277,4,a punchy standalone action tale about a spunky rebel alliance resistance group
1278,5,this instalment isnt about looking backwards in essence its a war movie and director gareth edwards keeps the momentum going with a string of stunning set pieces
1279,3,still too reliant on nostalgic fan-service but a clear step in the right direction for these newfangled star wars movies
1280,3,the force should have been stronger with this one
1281,3,the star wars franchise has built up a massive amount of cachet over the last several decades rogue one is going to need every bit of it
1282,5,yes its part of a series that is now eight movies strong but it also works alone as a movie about war oppression a dangerous heist a daring rebellion and a spark of hope that ignites the final stages of a revolution
1283,3,rogue one is less the fetish object that the force awakens is because it at least has the ambitions to create its own character dynamics and plot routes rather than coast on existing ones
1284,4,will give die-hard star wars fans multiple orgasmsrunneth over with star wars spectacle
1285,4,a thrilling but flawed drama that considers the cost of fighting for ones beliefs
1286,4,this star wars spinoff doesnt spin very far off from the franchise but its a serviceable stopgap between chapters
1287,2,boasts thin characters played by great actors scampering about far too many planets with names that sound like obscure venereal diseases its a star wars knockoff that happens to look a lot like a star wars movie
1288,4,rogue one builds to one of the best third acts in the entire franchise
1289,4,rogue one makes up for a shaky first act by punching into overdrive for an outstanding third act battle sequence that overwhelms in scale and intensity
